# Address automation task issues in the Security Hub

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Super** **Admin** , or **Admin** , you can quickly access information about the latest automation task issues that require your attention in your workspace using the "Address the issues blocking automation" card in the **Security Hub** view.

An automation task issue is raised when a workflow execution for that task type enters a state that cannot be resolved independently. Individual issue cards in the Security Hub provide you with the actions you can perform in the relevant workspace module or offer additional information by opening the corresponding help center article. If you can’t solve an issue on your side, the Cerby team automatically marks it under its review. For all cases, you can mark an issue as _read_ , indicating that you have acknowledged the issue exists.
