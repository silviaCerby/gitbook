As a workspace **Owner** , **Super Admin** , or **Admin** , you can customize the message Cerby displays to users when they attempt to change password or members settings or delete an account for an app with existing [setting restrictions](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10276184-explore-app-settings-restrictions).

To customize the user message for settings restrictions, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace using the Cerby web app.
2. Select the **Settings** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Workspace Configuration** page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.
3. Activate the **Extension settings** tab.
4. Activate the left **App settings restrictions** tab.
5. Click the **Edit message** button. The **Edit restriction messages** page is displayed.
6. Select the setting you want to customize from the left menu.
7. Activate the **Fully blocked** or **Prompt members to Cerby** tab, depending on the message you want to customize. The message to show to the user is displayed below.
8. Customize the message in the **Title** or **Content** fields.
9. Repeat steps 6 to 8 as necessary.
10. Click the **Save changes** button. A success message box is displayed.

Now you are done. Your new message will be displayed the next time a user accesses the corresponding app setting.
