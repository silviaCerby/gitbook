# Remove apps from setting restrictions

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app
* Workspace users must have the Cerby browser extension installed and logged in


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Super Admin** , or **Admin** , you can remove an existing [app setting restriction](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10276184-explore-app-settings-restrictions) so that Cerby stops monitoring users and their interactions with an app.

{% hint style="danger" %}


**IMPORTANT:** By removing restrictions, users will be able to change password or member settings and delete accounts directly in the app without being notified or blocked.


{% endhint %}

To remove one or multiple apps from the app settings restrictions list, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace using the Cerby web app.
2. Select the **Settings** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Workspace Configuration** page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.
3. Activate the **Extension settings** tab.
4. Activate the left **App settings restrictions** tab.
**TIP:** Search for the app you want to remove from the list by clicking the **Search** () icon, which displays the search field. As you type in the characters of the app, a list of matching apps is displayed below.
