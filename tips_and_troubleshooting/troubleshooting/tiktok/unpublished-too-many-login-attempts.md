# [UNPUBLISHED] Too many login attempts

TikTok may display the "Too many attempts. Try again later" message and temporarily restrict access to your account in the following scenarios:

* When you log in multiple times to your TikTok account from Cerby using the same web browser both in your computer or your mobile phone.
* When you log out from one account and you try to log in to another TikTok account using the web browser.
* When you try to rotate the password automatically from Cerby for an account with an active session but without user activity during multiple weeks.

### Solution

To solve the too many login attempts issue, you can perform the following actions depending on the device you use:

* Web browser on your computer
  * Use an alternative browser to log in to the account
