# Explore Partners

Success in today’s business environment often depends on external experts such as agencies, consultants, and service providers. Traditional collaboration methods risk credential leakage by sharing passwords insecurely or granting excessive access to external users.

**Cerby Partners** offers a governed, identity-first framework for sharing access to high-value accounts and Business Hubs, such as Meta or TikTok, with external agencies and contractors while maintaining full control and visibility.

Cerby currently supports the following methods for adding and collaborating with partners:

* [Native partner integration](#native-partner-integration)
* [Local partners](#local-partners)
* [Host-guest partnership](#host-guest-partnership)

The following sections outline each method.

## Native partner integration (Best for paid social and marketing)

If you already work with an agency through platforms such as **Meta Business Manager** or **TikTok for Business**, Cerby directly links to that existing relationship.

* **Invisible governance:** Achieve visibility into partner activity beyond what native business managers provide.
* **Centralized oversight:** Sync and import partner user information to maintain detailed oversight of your external workforce.
* **Frictionless onboarding:** Partners do not need to use Cerby. You can sync the existing relationship to create a centralized audit trail.

## Local partners (Best for high-touch contractors)

This option is ideal for individual contractors or small vendors who require direct access to your workspace tools without needing a separate workspace.

* **Direct management:** Invite external collaborators as a designated subgroup of guest users within your environment.
* **Scoped access:** Guests use a secure, Cerby-managed identity, allowing you to add or remove collaborators as needed.
* **Delegated invites:** Assign a "Guest Admin" from the partner organization to manage their team’s invites, reducing your administrative workload.

## Host-guest partnership (Best for enterprise agency partners)

This approach is designed for large-scale partnerships where both organizations maintain independent administrative controls.

* **Secure federation:** Create a secure connection between your "Host" workspace and a dedicated "Guest" workspace.
* **Role-based control:** Assign roles such as **Partnership Owner** and **Account Manager** to delegate access requests while retaining control of security settings.
* **Complete isolation:** Each workspace is managed by its own Admin, maintaining organizational boundaries while enabling seamless account sharing.

## The Partner security advantage

Cerby Partners is not only about sharing; it is about **reclaiming ownership** of your supply chain.

| **Capability** | **Benefit to the business** |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| **Credential masking** | External partners can log in and perform work via Cerby without ever seeing, touching, or "owning" the root passwords to your corporate accounts. |
| **Centralized offboarding** | When a project ends, you revoke access at the partnership level. Access is instantly pulled for the entire agency across all shared items. |
| **MFA guardrails** | Cerby manages the multi-factor authentication (MFA). You no longer have to worry about an agency employee using an insecure personal device or email for your brand's codes. |
| **Enhanced visibility** | Gain a centralized view of end-user actions, which is essential for preventing security risks and facilitating effective, audited collaboration. |
