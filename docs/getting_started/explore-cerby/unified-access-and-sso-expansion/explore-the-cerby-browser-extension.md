# Explore the Cerby Browser Extension: Your gateway to secure, frictionless access

Previously, security often reduced productivity. Users managed complex passwords for legacy systems, used physical tokens for MFA, and manually logged in to applications outside the corporate SSO.

The Cerby Browser Extension addresses these challenges by serving as a secure connection between your company’s identity provider and all applications, regardless of their security protocols.

## One identity, every application

The extension is the primary interface for the Cerby platform. It enables you to log in to any website or service with your work credentials, such as Okta or Microsoft Entra ID, for single sign-on (SSO) across all online platforms.

• Credential Injection: The extension securely retrieves your login details from your encrypted vault and enters them only when authorized, eliminating the need to type or view passwords.
• MFA Orchestration: When a site requires multi-factor authentication, the extension manages the process, allowing you to continue working without interruption.
• Instant Access: Access frequently used accounts directly from the extension’s sidebar without switching tabs.

## Secure shared access (without the risk)

For teams that require access to critical accounts, such as company social media or finance platforms, the Cerby extension enables secure delegation of access without sharing passwords.

• Invisible credentials: Team members can do their work without ever seeing or knowing the main password.
• Time-boxed sessions: Grant access for a defined period, ensuring credentials are unavailable after the project concludes.
• Enforced governance: Every login is recorded, providing IT with a clear audit trail of user access, even for applications that do not offer this capability.

## Security "at the edge"

The Cerby extension offers more than password storage. It protects your browsing by using a zero-knowledge approach, ensuring sensitive data is unlocked only in your browser and never on our servers.
