# Explore Passkeys in Cerby: The Future of Phishing-Resistant Access

Passwords are becoming obsolete as cyber threats evolve and static credentials remain vulnerable. Passkeys offer a faster, easier, and more secure method for accessing corporate applications.

Cerby enables you to govern passkeys, not just use them. We deliver FIDO2-backed, phishing-resistant authentication across your workforce, extending modern security standards to all applications.

## What are Passkeys?

Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords, based on the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) standard. Instead of memorizing a password, users rely on a unique cryptographic entity stored on their device. Authentication uses device biometrics, such as Face ID or Touch ID, or a hardware security key.

## Why Passkeys in Cerby?

Passkeys are more secure, but managing them at scale in an enterprise can be challenging, especially for team collaboration. Cerby addresses this with a centralized passkey management framework.

* **Phishing resistance:** Passkeys are cryptographically linked to the legitimate website domain, making them immune to guessing, data breaches, or phishing attacks.
* **Frictionless experience:** Users access critical accounts in seconds with biometric verification, reducing password fatigue.
* **Enterprise control:** Cerby enables IT administrators to monitor passkey usage organization-wide, ensuring consistent application of security to essential apps.

## The power of shared Passkeys

Traditionally, passkeys were limited to a single device, hindering team collaboration. Cerby solves this by maintaining passkey security while supporting teamwork.

| **Feature** | **Benefits for business** |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| **Secure delegation** | Grant team members access to passkey-protected accounts without compromising the underlying cryptographic credentials. |
| **Device agnostic** | Access your passkey-secured accounts across different devices and platforms while maintaining a single, consistent identity. |
| **Centralized revocation** | Instantly revoke a user's ability to use a shared passkey if they leave the team or project, without needing to reset the app's security. |

## A step toward passwordless maturity

Adopting passkeys is a process. The Cerby mobile app supports this transition by enabling a hybrid environment, securing legacy accounts with automated password policies and upgrading key applications to a passwordless, passkey-driven workflow.
