# [Video Guide] Getting started with Cerby

Hi there, welcome to Cerby!

We are a cybersecurity company focused on helping you and your organization manage, onboard, and secure the apps you use, as well as the accounts you share.

As an account owner or collaborator, you can access the following features of Cerby:

* Share accounts securely with any team member or third parties, such as contractors and agencies.
* Implement security best practices automatically to your apps.
* Access your apps automatically, without entering any credentials. You must only remember one set of credentials to log in to Cerby.
* Onboard new apps you need to do your job.
* Monitor activity on your accounts.

The solution we offer combines the following three clients that work together to provide you with the best experience:

* **Browser extension:** It enables you to log in to your accounts by automatically filling the credentials you store in Cerby in the corresponding fields of your apps. It also helps automate all of the security hygiene tasks available in Cerby.
