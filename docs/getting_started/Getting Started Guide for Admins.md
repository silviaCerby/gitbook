# Getting Started Guide for Admins

## Getting Started Guide for Admins

**Description:** This article describes the key initial steps you must perform to start using Cerby as an admin.

Hi there, welcome to Cerby!

If you are reading this guide, it means you have started using our platform, or you are interested in knowing more about us. We are a cybersecurity company focused on helping you and your organization onboard and secure the apps you use, as well as the accounts you share.

We automate common security hygiene tasks that are often left undone by business users, especially for apps managed outside of IT. Some examples of these apps include social media, bank accounts, eCommerce systems, internal apps, and legacy systems.

With Cerby, you can continue to onboard and manage your preferred solutions freely, with minimal but sufficient involvement from your IT department. The following are some of the benefits of our solution:

* **Manage accounts from a single user interface (UI).** Modify access permissions across the apps used by your team from a single place.
* **Empower your teams.** Enable your teams to share accounts securely with any team member or third parties, such as contractors and agencies.
* **Discover and audit all behavior in applications.** Monitor the applications registered by your team members and managed by Cerby to understand their usage.
* **Automate common security tasks and operations.** Enable security best practices automatically for all the applications in your workspace.
* **Remember only one set of credentials.** Access automatically all the accounts of the apps you use daily from your workspace without entering any credentials. You must only remember your credentials to log in to your Cerby workspace.

So, let’s get started. This guide contains the following basic information:

* How does Cerby work?
* What’s a workspace?
* What’s a role in Cerby?
* What’s the dashboard?
* What can I do from the dashboard?
* How do I start using Cerby?

The following sections describe each topic.

***

## **How does Cerby work?**

The solution offered by Cerby combines the following three clients that work together to provide you with the best experience.

* **Browser extension:** It enables you to log in to your accounts by automatically filling the credentials you store in Cerby in the corresponding fields of your apps. It also helps automate all of the security hygiene tasks available in Cerby.

The Cerby browser extension is available for the following browsers:

```
* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cerby-s-browser-extension/)

* [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cerbys-browser-extension/clccplmaaeihbagbefjinmclielobnkb)

* [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cerbys-browser-extension/bbaiiaogfdgpbapebajffliefkfipoif)

* [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/mx/app/cerby-web-extension/id1581820030?l=en&mt=12)
```

**TIP:** For instructions to install the browser extension, see the \[How to install the Cerby browser extension]\(https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5620156-video-how-to-install- cerby-s-browser-extension) video.

* **Mobile application:** It enables you to access your accounts from your mobile phone. It also serves as a second device to authenticate for sensitive tasks.

The Cerby mobile app is available for the following operating systems:

```
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerby)

* [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/co/app/cerby/id1533747684)
```

**TIP:** For instructions to install the mobile app, see the \[How to install and set up the Cerby mobile app]\(https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5621519-video-how-to-install-and- setup-the-cerby-mobile-application) video.

* **Web application:** It enables you to manage all your accounts, share access across your teams, and access your accounts, all from a single place.

The [Cerby web app](https://app.cerby.com/) is available for any browser.

***

## **What’s a workspace?**

A workspace is an environment in which organizations and users can access a set of shared accounts to log in to other apps. For example, an organization can leverage a Cerby workspace to log in to their social media accounts and manage the overall security of these accounts.

Through a Cerby workspace, organizations and users can also manage their accounts and perform the following actions:

* Manage user permissions.
* Manage app accounts.
* Onboard multi-factor authentication (MFA) and rotate passwords for accounts.
* Manage user provisioning and deprovisioning.
* Configure authentication with an identity provider (IDP).
* Retrieve analytics for account usage and user activity.

Organizations may have one or multiple workspaces depending on their needs. However, usually, one organization has one workspace.

Currently, you can only create a workspace from an invitation sent by the Cerby team from our official email address, [help@cerby.com](mailto:help@cerby.com). After creating your workspace, its name is displayed and identified as follows **< workspace name>.cerby.com**.

***

## **What’s a role in Cerby?**

We leverage roles to identify what you can or can’t do in Cerby and within your applications.

A role is a set of permissions that represent the tasks, activities, or functions you can perform as a user. Cerby manages roles at a workspace and item level, and roles are also inherited from the configuration of your apps.

The advantage of using role-based access management is that, after logging in to your workspace, you are automatically granted permissions depending on your role.

The following are the different roles in Cerby depending on your access level:

* Workspace-level roles
  * Workspace Owner
  * Workspace Super Admin
  * Workspace Admin
  * Workspace User
  * Workspace Guest user
* Item-level roles
  * Owner
  * Collaborator

For detailed information about roles, read the article [How Cerby manages roles](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8500649-how-cerby-manages-roles).

***

## **What’s the dashboard?**

The dashboard is the graphical interface of the Cerby web app that integrates information about users, accounts, configuration, services, and applications.

Every time you log in to the Cerby web app, you land on the homepage, which corresponds to the All accounts view, as shown in **Figure 1**.

!\[]\(images/Vux09SPHs9BnCewr96J8vtal3LyYQsgdkcO40QAxvRFhyi\_JzubloWH7JcbXt8TiQCpDOm2dc8L42y0wBoF0NaBLEMj2Sd1dU8CU2Y4r0IenSbbbMrwGt1s6rmXRSyrw- XU3hJdG8iAMXW2PDN3IAw)

**Figure 1. Homepage of the Cerby Dashboard**

To navigate through the different features of Cerby, the dashboard contains the left navigation drawer and the main section that contains the different views, pages, information, and account cards.

### **Account cards**

Account cards are the most important components of the dashboard. They consist of card-type buttons displayed on the dashboard homepage representing the accounts from the multiple apps you can access and manage through Cerby. Account cards redirect you to log in and authenticate automatically into your apps.

Every time you add an account to Cerby, the corresponding account card is created in the dashboard. To learn how to add an account, see the 2. Add Your Accounts to Cerby section.

As shown in **Figure 2** , the default view of account cards is a grid, but you can also display them as a list. To select every view option, click the **List** or **Grid** icons located at the top of the main section.

!\[]\(images/iIXBf-VnRyL-H\_6VTeuVuIODIjF3yR- Zi6hD5pO02lPJdeAX4cs3fR9DGo0lWakRwzN2\_jcr3\_Iz1xs6zDUf3r8metrPm2flaOspe3Fp4l5N0M4JIpo- KVmL943AyoLGzDCYctJqoxOYHAlHmtOBQQ)

**Figure 2. Grid View of Example Account Cards**

You can also display all the account cards or group them by application or service provider by selecting the corresponding option from the **Group by** drop-down list located at the top of the main section.

## **How do I start using Cerby?**

Now that you know all the basic information, it’s time to start using Cerby. We prepared the following steps to get you covered:

1. Configure your Cerby workspace
2. Add your accounts to Cerby
3. Start enforcing security

The following sections describe each step.

### **1. Configure your Cerby workspace**

To leverage the organization directory and authentication you have with an IDP, you can configure your Cerby workspace to synchronize information. With this configuration, Cerby can perform the following actions:

* Import the users and contacts from your organization directory so you can share accounts easily with them.
* Provision and deprovision users automatically.
* Leverage authentication to Cerby through an IDP.

### Supported IDPs

Currently, Cerby supports the following IDPs, and you can read the documentation from our [Cerby Help Center](https://help.cerby.com) to guide you on how to configure them:

* Okta
  * [Enable Okta User Provisioning with SCIM](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5457593-how-to-enable-okta-user-provisioning-with-scim)

### **2. Add your accounts to Cerby**

After configuring your organization directory, it’s time to get down to business and start adding your application accounts to securely manage their access through Cerby.

Unlike other cybersecurity platforms, Cerby goes beyond storing the login credentials of your applications. We have built app-specific automation workflows to help you comply with security policies and reduce exposure to cyber-attacks.

To add your accounts to Cerby, you have the following options:

* Using the wizard
* Sharing existing accounts
* Sharing a business center account and assets
* Migrating accounts from your password manager

The following sections describe each option.

### Using the wizard

The **Add Account** wizard guides you through the process of adding an account, whether it is for an app currently supported by Cerby with automation workflows or not, as mentioned above.

Also, you can add business center accounts to manage provisioning and deprovisioning of access to your pages and assets in social media from your Cerby workspace.

To add accounts using the wizard, complete the following steps:

1. Click the **Add account** button from the **All accounts** view. The **Add Account** wizard is displayed.
2. Follow the instructions of the wizard to add your account. The corresponding account card is added to the **All accounts** view when you complete the process.

To migrate accounts, complete the following steps:

1. Click the **Add account** button from the **All accounts** view. The **Add Account** wizard is displayed.
2. Click the **Migrate accounts from your password manager** button.
3. Follow the instructions of the wizard to migrate one or multiple accounts. The corresponding account cards are added to the **All Accounts** view when you complete the process.

### **3. Start enforcing security**

To start implementing security best practices in your accounts, you can enforce and trigger them from your Cerby workspace.

You can enforce the following security best practices:

* Rotating passwords
* Using Cerby-managed email addresses and phone numbers
* Turning on MFA

The following sections describe each security best practice.

### Rotating passwords

Cerby can automatically rotate passwords and provide secure and robust new passwords for your accounts. This feature is only enabled for supported apps through the Cerby web app.

You can enforce password rotation for all accounts within a determined time, and you can trigger rotation from external actions, such as deprovisioned employees and account breaches.

To rotate the password of your accounts, you have the following options:

* From the account settings
  1. Click the **Settings** button of the corresponding account card. The account settings page is displayed.
  2. Click the **Rotate Password** button.
* From the **Policies** view
  1. Activate the **Password Rotation** switch in the **Policies** view to require password rotation for all accounts within the workspace every determined time.
  2. Activate automatic password rotation for supported apps every determined time.

### Using Cerby-managed email addresses and phone numbers

Cerby provides and manages securely generated email addresses and phone numbers you can use for your accounts and across your organization.

By managing these services, Cerby can improve the logging-in process of your applications by automatically filling your verification codes when MFA is turned on. These codes are retrieved from your **Shared Inbox** in Cerby.

You can create a Cerby-managed email address and phone number through the web app after adding an account to Cerby.

To create a Cerby-managed email address, complete the following steps:

1. Click the **Settings** button of the corresponding account card in the **All accounts** view of the dashboard. The account settings page is displayed.

3. Click the **Protect my email address** button. A success message is displayed indicating the email address was created.
4. Click the **Set up email address** button. The **Auto-forward messages** dialog box is displayed.

**NOTE:** The auto-forward messages feature of Cerby enables you to designate recipients for the emails you receive in your Cerby-managed email address. You can configure it later from your account settings.

5. Click the **Skip** button. The **Update email address on** dialog box is displayed with the email address you created.
6. Copy the email address.
7. Open the account settings of your app in a new browser window.
8. Configure the email address manually in the account settings of your app.
9. Go back to the browser window with the Cerby web app.
10. Click the **Confirm** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you configure the Cerby-managed email address on your app before clicking the **Confirm** button.

To create a Cerby-managed phone number, complete the following steps:

1. Click the **Settings** button of the corresponding account card. The account settings page is displayed.

8. Select the **I'm using this phone number for MFA** option if you are going to use the Cerby-managed phone number as a MFA verification method.
9. Click the **Create Phone Number** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

### Turning on MFA

Cerby help you implement MFA to improve the security of your accounts significantly.

You can configure the Cerby mobile app as an authenticator, and you can also use Cerby-managed email addresses and phone numbers as verification methods to improve your logging-in experience, as you saw in the Using Cerby-Managed Email Addresses and Phone Numbers section.

Unlike other authenticator apps, when you turn on MFA with Cerby, verification codes are distributed to all the account members whenever they need them.

To turn on MFA for your accounts, you have the following options:

* Automatically from the Cerby web app, with a single click, for supported apps
  1. Click the **Settings** button of the corresponding account card. The account settings page is displayed.
  2. Activate the **Second Layer of Protection** switch in the **TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION** section.
