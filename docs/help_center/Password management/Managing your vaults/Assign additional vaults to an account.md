# Assign additional vaults to an account

**Description:** This article describes how to add a vault to an account manually.

To enhance security and usability for **Account Owners** , **Admins** , and
**Super** **Admins** and to minimize the risk associated with a leaked vault
key, Cerby has enabled the ability to manually add cloud and local vaults to
accounts. This capability enhances user flexibility, leveraging the advantages
of each vault type. It also allows users to optimize their account management
strategies, ensuring security, accessibility, and efficiency tailored to their
specific needs and preferences.

By assigning an account to a local encryption vault, the following occurs:

  * You get increased account security by keeping data securely encrypted on the local device.

  * Your accounts adhere to the zero-knowledge principles because only the user has access to the encryption keys on their devices, ensuring that no one else, including Cerby, can access the data.

  * Automation tasks might be limited because of availability and accessibility to the LEKs.

By assigning an account to a cloud vault, the following occurs:

  * You get enhanced automation actions through seamless automated actions such as automatic multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password rotation.

  * Cerby gets faster access to encryption keys, allowing it to manage and execute automation tasks efficiently.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** By adding cloud vaults, the account
reduces the degree of security stated by the Zero-knowledge architecture. You
are informed of this fact when adding cloud vaults to an account. To learn
more about the differences between each vault type, refer to the article, [How
