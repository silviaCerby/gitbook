# Explore passkeys in Cerby

**Description:** This article describes the passkeys feature available for the Cerby mobile app.

With the Cerby mobile app, you can log in to your accounts using passkeys; no
passwords are required.

This feature enhances your security by storing your account information on
your device and using your unique biometric data to authenticate. This
combination of device and biometric authentication makes it nearly impossible
for attackers to access your credentials.

# **Supported features**

The following are the supported features of passkeys with the Cerby mobile
app:

  * Add passkeys to any [app that supports passkey authentication](https://passkeys.directory/) for existing accounts in your workspace. 

  * (For iOS only) Create a new account in your Cerby workspace while also creating a passkey for an app. 

  * Log in to your accounts using passkeys with the Cerby mobile app on your mobile device or combined with another device.

  * Update your passkeys whenever necessary.

The following are the supported operating systems (OS) and Cerby mobile app
versions for using passkeys:

# **Considerations**

Note the following important considerations for using passkeys in the Cerby
mobile app:

  * Cross-device login is supported for devices that do not have passkey support, such as laptops or desktops, by using the Cerby mobile app on your mobile device.  
​**NOTE:** The Bluetooth function could be required for this login type.

  * You must enable biometric verification using the Cerby mobile app. Passkeys require user verification, which is confirmed through the biometric hardware on your mobile device.  
​**NOTE:** To learn how to enable the biometric login in your Cerby mobile
app, read the article [Turn on the Biometrics Login
feature](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10355971-turn-on-the-biometrics-
login-feature).

  * Currently, Android does not support account creation when creating a new passkey for an app.

  * The Cerby web app and browser extension do not support passkeys as of now.
