As a secret or secret item (such as WiFi, SSH keys, database, server, and

  1. Open the Cerby mobile app on your phone.

  2. Log in to your Cerby workspace.

  3. Activate the **Secrets** tab located at the top on iOS or Android. The **Secrets** screen is displayed.

  4. Tap the corresponding secret card. The secret details screen is displayed.

  5. Tap the right arrow icon from the **Members** list within the **Sharing** section. The **View members** screen is displayed.  
​**NOTE:** To update guest users’ role access from external parties, tap the
right arrow from the **Guest users** list.

  6. Select the corresponding member from the list. A menu is displayed at the bottom.

  7. Tap the **Update role** button from the menu. The list of roles is displayed.

  8. Select the user’s new role on the secret:

     * **Owner:** Users can share access and manage the secret configuration.

     * **Collaborator:** Users can only view the secret or secret item content.

  9. Tap the **Save** button.

Now you are done.
