As an account **Owner** , you can update other users' roles on your accounts
using the Cerby mobile app. You can select the roles of **Owner** or
**Collaborator** for them.

To update a user’s role on an account, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Open the Cerby mobile app on your phone.

  2. Log in to your Cerby workspace.

  3. Tap the corresponding account card. The account details screen is displayed.

  4. Tap the right arrow icon from the **Members** list within the **Sharing** section. The **View members** screen is displayed.  
**NOTE:** To update guest users’ role access, tap the right arrow from the
**Guest users** list.

  5. Select the corresponding member from the list. A menu is displayed at the bottom.

  6. Tap the **Update role** button from the menu. The list of roles is displayed.

  7. Select the user’s new role on the account:

     * **Owner:** Users can share access and manage the account configuration.

     * **Collaborator:** Users can only log in to the account.

  8. Tap the **Save** button.

Now you are done.

**IMPORTANT:** Users who have received shared access to the same account
multiple times appear with the **Mixed** **role** status or an information
tooltip in the Cerby role column. When clicking the drop-down list, the
**Change role type** dialog box is displayed with each access grant and role.
You can only update the role if shared access is via a direct grant to the
account or a collection to which you have the **Owner** role.
