With the **Activity** view, you can monitor and analyze activity on your Cerby
workspace in real time. This view contains information about events on
accounts, partners, teams, integrations, secrets, and automated tasks.

The **Activity** view offers different filtering options, enabling you to
customize displayed data to focus on specific events, accounts, or users,
ensuring you only see the most relevant information.

The data displayed on the view is organized into the following columns:

  * The time when each event was registered

  * A description or category of the activity

  * The associated account

  * The application where the event occurred

  * The user involved in the event

You can monitor events in real time and get immediate insights that support
quick, informed decision-making, enabling you to respond to potential issues
as they arise, thus enhancing workspace security and control.

Furthermore, the **Activity** view also includes a report download feature to
export activity data as a CSV file for deeper analysis, record-keeping, and
sharing insights with team members or stakeholders, making it a powerful tool
for maintaining and optimizing workspace performance.
