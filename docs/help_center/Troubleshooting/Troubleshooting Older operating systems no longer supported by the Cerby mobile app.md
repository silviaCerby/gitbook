# Troubleshooting: Older operating systems no longer supported by the Cerby mobile app

**Description:** This article describes how to troubleshoot the issues with old operating system versions no longer supported by the Cerby mobile app.

This article helps you solve the issues with older operating system (OS)
versions in your mobile phone, both for iOS and Android, that are no longer
supported by the Cerby mobile app.

# **Cause of the problem**

As of October 2024, Cerby requires Android 11 and iOS 16 as the minimum
supported OS versions due to security updates and performance improvements.
The versions of the Cerby mobile app enforcing this requirement are the
following:

  * [iOS v.1.0.215](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cerby/id1533747684)

  * [Android v1.0.179](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerby&hl=en)

Mobile phones that have old OS versions and the Cerby mobile app already
installed will continue to work; however, they will no longer receive new
updates or security improvements from Apple and Google.

Additionally, the Cerby mobile app will be removed from the Google Play Store
for these devices because they will be more vulnerable to security threats and
may not receive the latest features and bug fixes.

# **Solution**

To solve the issues with older versions of the Cerby mobile app, you must
complete the following steps:

  * **iOS**

    1. Update your mobile phone's OS to at least iOS 16. For instructions on updating your mobile phone, read the [Update your iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118575) official documentation. 

    2. Reinstall the Cerby mobile app.

  * **Android**

    1. Update your mobile phone's OS to at least Android 11. For instructions on updating your mobile phone, read the [Check & update your Android version](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en) official documentation.

    2. Reinstall the Cerby mobile app.

Unfortunately, the iPhone 7 and older models are no longer compatible with iOS
16.0 and all newer OS versions, so you will not be able to update them. We
recommend using a compatible mobile phone. Also, if you are unable to update
Android, leveraging a compatible mobile phone is strongly recommended.
