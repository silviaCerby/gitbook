# Perform a hard refresh on a web page

**Description:** This article describes how to perform a hard refresh of a web page, depending on the browser you are using.

When updating or troubleshooting Cerby‑related content, a web page refresh is
commonly required to reflect the most recent changes. A regular page refresh
might not reflect these changes because browsers store assets such as style
sheets, scripts, and images to improve performance. In these cases, you may
need to perform a hard refresh to fetch a clean copy of the page from the
server.

The following is the difference between a regular and hard refresh in a
browser:

  * **Regular refresh:** Reloads the page but might use cached resources.

  * **Hard refresh:** Forces the browser to clear the cache for that page and reload everything from scratch.

The following are the cases for which you can use a hard refresh on a web
page:

  * You’re not seeing recent updates to Cerby.

  * Layouts or styles seem broken after changes.

  * Changes have been applied to your workspace, and they are not shown on your browser.
