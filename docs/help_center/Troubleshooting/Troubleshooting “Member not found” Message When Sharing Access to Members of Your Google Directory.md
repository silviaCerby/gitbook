# Troubleshooting: “Member not found” Message When Sharing Access to Members of Your Google Directory

**Description:** This article describes how to troubleshoot the “Member not found” message.

This article helps you fix the “Member not found” message displayed when you
want to share access to an account with members of your Google directory.

# **Cause of the Problem**

When you log in to your Cerby workspace using Google as your identity
provider, you must grant Cerby access to your Google account. The goal is to
leverage your contacts and your organization’s GSuite to share accounts in
Cerby.

The “Member not found” message is displayed in the **Share Account** dialog
box of the Cerby dashboard, as shown in **Figure 1**. This dialog box is
displayed when you click the **Share Account** button of the corresponding
account card from the **All accounts** view.

The problem occurs when you enter the user name of the member of your Google
directory in the search bar, but one of the following conditions is met:

  * Access to your Google account was not successfully granted to Cerby.

  * The member of your Google directory does not exist.

# **Solution**

To solve the sharing account problem, you must complete the following main
steps:

  1. Log out from your Cerby workspace

  2. Log in to your Cerby workspace allowing access to your Google account

The following sections describe each step.

## 2\. Log In to Your Cerby Workspace Allowing Access to Your Google Account

To log in to your Cerby workspace allowing access to your Google account,
complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace. The **Sign in with Google** dialog box is displayed.

**IMPORTANT:** Google can alternately display one of two versions of the
**Sign in with Google** dialog box. Depending on the dialog box, you must
perform different actions in step 2.

  2. Allow Cerby access to your Google account depending on the dialog box version:

     * Dialog box with checkboxes:

       1. Select the **See and download your contacts** and **See and download your organization’s GSuite directory** options, as shown in **Figure 2**.

     * Dialog box without checkboxes:

       1. Click the **Allow** button. The Cerby dashboard is displayed.

and **See and download your organization’s GSuite directory** options are
enabled by default, as shown in **Figure 3**.

Now, try to share an account again.

**IMPORTANT:** If you still encounter the “Member not found” message, you must
contact your GSuite administrator to verify if the user exists in the
directory.
