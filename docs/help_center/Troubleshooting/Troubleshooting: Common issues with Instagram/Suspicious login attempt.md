# Suspicious login attempt

When you log in automatically to an Instagram account from Cerby using a new
device (computer or mobile phone) from a new location, Instagram displays the
**Suspicious Login Attempt** dialog box or screen asking you to verify your
identity, as shown in **Figure 1**.

**NOTE:** This behavior occurs whether you have multi-factor authentication
(MFA) turned on or not. Also, it may happen when Cerby performs automated
tasks, such as turning on MFA and rotating passwords.

In the dialog box or screen, Instagram asks you to verify your identity by
sending a six-digit security code to the email address registered in the
account.

## Solution

To solve the login attempt prompt, click the **Send Security Code** button
from the **Suspicious Login Attempt** dialog box or screen. You will receive a
security code at the registered email address.

To retrieve the security code when you have a Cerby-managed email address, you
must forward the email because the message in the **Shared Inbox** does not
display the code.

Follow the instructions in the [How to forward a message from your Cerby
inbox](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6119548-how-to-forward-a-message-
from-your-cerby-inbox) article, and then open your email to copy the code.

To prevent the **Suspicious Login Attempt** dialog box or screen from being
displayed in the future, Cerby recommends you turn on MFA with Cerby as an
authenticator app and disable the login requests settings on Instagram.
Complete the following steps:

  1. Turn on MFA manually. Follow the instructions in the [How to turn on MFA in Instagram manually](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6422083-video-how-to-turn-on-2fa-in-instagram-manually) video. 

**NOTE:** If you have already turned on MFA with Cerby as an authenticator
app, continue to step 2.

  2. Tap the **Profile** button with your picture or avatar that is located on the right in the bottom navigation drawer of the Instagram mobile app. The **Edit profile** screen is displayed.

  3. Tap the **Menu** icon located in the top right of the screen. A drop-down list is displayed.

  4. Tap the **Settings** button from the drop-down list. The **Settings** screen is displayed.

  5. Tap the **Security** button. The **Security** screen is displayed.

  6. Tap the **Two-factor authentication** button located in the **Login security** section. The **Two-Factor Authentication** screen is displayed with the **Two-factor authentication is on** section.

  7. Tap the **Additional methods** button in the **How you get login codes** section. The **Additional methods** screen is displayed.

  8. Deactivate the switch of the **Login requests** option.
