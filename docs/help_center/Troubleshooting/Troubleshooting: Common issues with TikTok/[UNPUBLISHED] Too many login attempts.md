# [UNPUBLISHED] Too many login attempts

TikTok may display the "Too many attempts. Try again later" message and
temporarily restrict access to your account in the following scenarios:

  * When you log in multiple times to your TikTok account from Cerby using the same web browser both in your computer or your mobile phone.

  * When you log out from one account and you try to log in to another TikTok account using the web browser.

  * When you try to rotate the password automatically from Cerby for an account with an active session but without user activity during multiple weeks.

actions depending on the device you use:
