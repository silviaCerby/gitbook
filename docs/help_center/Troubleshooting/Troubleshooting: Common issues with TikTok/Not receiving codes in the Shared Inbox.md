# Not receiving codes in the Shared Inbox

When you have configured a Cerby-managed email address or phone number in your
TikTok account, whether you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) turned on
or not, TikTok may take some time to send a verification code when logging in
or rotating the password automatically. Therefore, no message is sent and
stored in your **Shared Inbox** in Cerby.

## Solution

To solve the issue with not receiving verification codes, Cerby recommends
waiting the 60 seconds suggested by TikTok before retrying to send a code.
Sometimes, TikTok queues multiple messages and sends them all at once.
