  3. Select the**My Profile** option. The **My Profile** page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.

  4. Activate the **Dev Tools** tab. The **Developer tools** section is displayed with the **Copy Bearer Token** information.

  5. Click the **Copy token** button. Your bearer token is copied to the clipboard.
