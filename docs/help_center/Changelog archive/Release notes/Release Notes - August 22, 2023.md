# Release Notes - August 22, 2023

# New Features

  * We heard you, IT and System admins. We now have a way to deploy the Cerby browser extension to your corporate computers using an MDM service and a configuration file.

With this solution, you can install the extension on MacOS and Windows for the
following web browsers:

    * Safari

    * Microsoft Edge

    * Mozilla Firefox

    * Google Chrome

For more information, contact our Customer Support team by sending an email to
[support@cerby.com](mailto:support@cerby.com) or a message through the help
chat of the Cerby dashboard.

  * Prepare the holding back tears emoji. We’ve tuned up the Tenants feature with the following releases:

    * Application assets such as ad accounts, pixels, and pages are now supported, and you can manage access to them through Cerby:

      * Assign assets to a user

      * Edit the user’s native role on assets

      * Remove the assets assigned to users

Just click the **Manage assets** button of the corresponding user in the
**Members** tab of the tenant details page, and a dialog box will help you
assign assets, as shown in **Figure 1**.

  * When logging in automatically, tenant service accounts now redirect users to the corresponding collaboration space.

  * Great news for all the workspaces using Google as their identity provider and the GSuite directory. **Account Owners** and **Secret Owners** can now share items with users who have not yet logged in to the workspace. Cerby will send them an invite through email to ask them to log in.

  * Have you ever looked for end-user documentation about Cerby? We made it easier to access our Help Center from the dashboard. Just click **Help and products** from the left navigation drawer, and a drop-down list will be displayed. Select the **Help Center** option, and we will open the Cerby Help Center on a new tab. Happy reading!
