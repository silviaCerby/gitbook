# Release Notes - July 24, 2023

# New Features

  * Remember how excited you were in April with the beta release of the [Save credentials at login](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/7239387-beta-how-to-save-your-credentials-at-login-via-the-cerby-browser-extension) feature? Guess what!? We improved the experience, and now you can add accounts to Cerby whether you have an active session with the Cerby browser extension or not.

Just go to the login page of your application using your web browser and log
in by entering your credentials, and the Cerby browser extension will do its
magic.

If you don’t have an active session, you’ll be asked to log in to the Cerby
browser extension before adding the account, as shown in **Figure 1**.

After logging in, the experience is the same: Cerby will prefill the account
details, and you just have to click the **Add account** button. Make sure you
have the latest version of the Cerby browser extension installed

  * Bulk actions to remove users from a tenant are now supported in the **Members** tab of the tenant details page. Just select the checkbox of the corresponding users in the table, and a selector will be displayed, as shown in **Figure 2**.
