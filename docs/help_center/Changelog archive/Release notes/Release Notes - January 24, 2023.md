# Release Notes - January 24, 2023

# New Features

  * The [Tenants](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831122-what-are-tenants) feature is now available to help our customers simplify user and access management for tenants. We define tenants as apps with collaboration spaces, such as workspaces, teams, and dashboards, where each user has login credentials. With a tenant connected to Cerby, customers can centrally and securely manage all users from Cerby by mapping them to their corporate directory.

  * The **Shared Inbox** is now available in the pop-up and inline Cerby browser extension.

  * Collections now have their own tab in the **Teams** view.

  * In-context alerts now identify automation workflows that need a CAPTCHA to be resolved for the following apps:

    * Emplifi

    * Shutterstock

    * TikTok

  * The time-based one-time password (TOTP) page is now handled when automatically turning on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for a Shopify account.

  * Collapsible sections in the Cerby web app now remain open when switching screens and until users close them.

  * Pagination and infinite scroll are now implemented in the account listing in the Cerby browser extension's inline menu and pop-up screen.

  * The list of users in the **Unknown users** tab for a business center account is now sorted alphabetically.

  * The **Reason for request** field is now implemented in the **Add new partner** dialog box.
