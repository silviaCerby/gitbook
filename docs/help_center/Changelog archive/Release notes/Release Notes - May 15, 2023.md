# Release Notes - May 15, 2023

# New Features

  * Love keeps coming to our Cerby mobile app. With the versions [v1.0.89](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerby&hl=en&gl=US) for Android and [v1.0.39](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cerby/id1533747684) for iOS, you can now do the following:

    * View secrets configured with an identity challenge. Behind the scenes, Cerby ensures that only the device requesting to view the secret can open it.

    * Know when you reached the end of the list of accounts and secrets when you scroll down. Cerby the dog will let you know, wink.

    * Access secrets inside collections.

    * View the teams with shared access to your secrets. Previously, you could only view the team members individually.

    * Identify easily if an email address or phone number is managed by Cerby. We added a tag in the account details screen.

  * A secret without a text body is still a secret. That’s why we support them now.

  * Talking about improvements, you can now benefit from the following using the Cerby web app:

    * A **Shared via** column was implemented in the **Members** tab of an account, secret, and collection details page. The goal is to let you know how an item is shared with you.

    * The grid view is available to display the accounts and secrets in their corresponding tab inside the collection details page.

    * A button is available to add accounts or secrets when you are on the account or secret details pages. Just activate the **Accounts** or **Secrets** tab and click the corresponding **Manage accounts** or **Manage secrets** button.

  * We take information security seriously. In compliance with the SOC 2 Type II certification, we’ve implemented a **Terms of service agreement** dialog box for all our users. Please take a minute to review and accept it when it appears.

  * The remaining pieces of the [Password Manager Importer](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/7175132-how-to-use-the-password-manager-importer) feature are in their place. Here’s what you can import now:

    * Folders and subfolders of secure notes with and without attachments to collections

    * Missing team members in bulk with a CSV file.

    * Account- and secret-level permissions for users.

  * Tenant admins, rest assured. Now, Cerby got you covered with automatic daily checks for updates for Apple and Verizon [tenants](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831152-how-to-use-tenants).

    * The app kept loading when tapping an empty collection.

    * The keyboard blocked the **Message** field when sharing an account and entering a message, making it difficult to know what you were writing.
