Welcome to a new chapter in your Cerby experience.

  * Let's keep you hyped with good news. We've been sniffing new ground, leading to the successful deployment of our cloud infrastructure in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo!   
With this strategic move, we can provide top-notch service to our valued
customers across Asia with enhanced performance and reliability.

  * Talking about suiting customer needs, we’ve also released a new multi-factor authentication method (MFA) for you to confirm your identity for sensitive actions, such as viewing or editing a secret. 

In addition to push notifications sent to the Cerby mobile app, you can now
receive a magic link in your email address.

methods](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9462605-confirm-your-identity-
with-cerby-s-mfa-methods).

  * Ready for a long-awaited release? Well, we’ve launched the second phase of the account autosave feature, improving the seamless experience of saving your login and signup credentials in Cerby with the browser extension.

In addition to the current individual experience, workspace **Admins** and
**Super Admins** can now manage which website domains are allowed or excluded
for all workspace users. All configuration is done through the Cerby web app,
as shown in **Figure 2**.

autosave).

  * We know you wanted to have more visibility in your App integrations. That’s why we released a feature that enables workspace **Super Admins** in **All-Access Mode** to search and view the assets of their SaaS and paid social apps connected to Cerby.

  * Regarding App integrations, we have an update for your Meta Business Manager.  
Now, you don’t need a connected account to perform a check for updates from
the Cerby web app. Also, you can control from the app details page if you want
to request users to save their username and password in Cerby; it’s just a
matter of activating the corresponding switch.

## **Cerby web app**

Check out what’s new in our Cerby web app:

  * We've fine-tuned the report you can export from the **All members** view to provide you with more information to take action on the security of your workspace and users.

You can now see a column in the CSV file with the status of each user's Cerby
account related to multi-factor authentication (MFA).

  * When you trigger an automated task to log in to your accounts from the Cerby web app, but don’t have the browser extension installed, you are now prompted to install it.

  * We’ve trained our Cerby platform to automatically refresh your web app when we release a new version of it, even when you leave your web browser open with an active session. Rest assured, as you’ll always have the latest features and updates.

  * This one goes to all of our users who could potentially have “checkmarkophobia.” We have stopped showing the security widget for all of the accounts that don’t support or don’t have the following features enabled to protect them:

    * Cerby-managed phone number

    * Cerby-managed email address

    * Multi-factor authentication (MFA) managed by Cerby as an authenticator app

    * Password rotation

    * Saving backup codes

Now, we show the widget on the account details page if at least one of the
aforementioned features is enabled.

## **Cerby browser extension**

Explore the latest features in our Cerby browser extension:

  * The in-context alerts received some love to provide you with a better user experience. 

We’ll still guide you through the automated login to your accounts with the
Cerby browser extension but in a less intrusive way. Now, we only display
messages when your intervention is required or when you need to know what’s
happening.

**Figures 3** and**4** show how the new in-context alerts look.

is required

  * We don’t want you to lose your password when signing up for an account and using the password generator through the inline menu of the Cerby browser extension. In v1.0.312, we added a Copy icon to the inline menu so you can copy to the clipboard the password you generate.

## **Cerby mobile app**

Dive into the newest additions to our Cerby mobile app:

  * Collaboration with external parties is now a reality when using the Cerby mobile app. You can now share your accounts with a [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2). 

The process is the same as sharing accounts with other users or teams: through
the account details screen after tapping the **Share** icon. This feature was
released in v1.0.167 for Android.

  * Here’s another one on account management in v1.0.167 for Android. You can now view the different roles a user has been granted on an account, whether a direct share or via a team. Just tap the right arrow icon from the **Sharing** section of the account details screen to display the **View members** screen. There, select the user from the list to display the **Update Roles** screen with the details of each role grant.

As a bonus, you can also update the user role or remove user access from the
**Update Roles** screen.

  * For your convenience, we’ve added a **Download** icon for you to save the attachments of a secret on your mobile phone both for iOS and Android.
