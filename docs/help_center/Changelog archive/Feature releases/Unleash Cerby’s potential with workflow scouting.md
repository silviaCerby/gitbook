# Unleash Cerby’s potential with workflow scouting

**Description:** This article describes the benefits of Scout for recording your tasks to accelerate the workflow building process.

**Release date:** October 25, 2024

Scout is your new getaway to enabling building app integrations in Cerby
faster than ever before. Starting today, your organization can ask for access
to **Scout by Cerby** in the extension stores.

Scout is the perfect choice if you are looking to expand your app ecosystem
quickly. Instead of waiting weeks for custom integrations, Scout enables rapid
and user-centric development, so you can refine existing functionalities or
roll out new features with minimal delays. This speed translates directly into
increased productivity, enabling your team to focus on delivering value rather
than being bogged down by long integration timelines. _How_? Scout provides
the Cerby Development team with everything they need to automate manual
processes so you can focus on more important projects.

The workflows or tasks you can scout are the following:

  * Log in to your account

  * Update your account's password

  * Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA)

  * Invite a user to your app

  * Remove a user from your app

  * Update a user's role in your app

You are in control of everything! Scout only works on demand, meaning you
decide when to activate it, and only workspace **Admins** can use it after
their organization requests access to this extension from Cerby. Rest assured,
Scout’s privacy-focused design and standards exclusively capture user
workflows on a webpage while masking all input data to ensure that sensitive
information remains fully protected. Cerby doesn’t record or store any input
values entered during scouting.

Check out how the Scout browser extension looks, as shown in **Figure 1**.
