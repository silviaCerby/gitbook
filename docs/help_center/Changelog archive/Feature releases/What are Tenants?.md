# What are Tenants?

**Description:** This article describes the key benefits of the Tenants feature to centralize management of your business app from Cerby.

**Release date:** December 23, 2022

Do your day-to-day activities involve painstaking manual tasks to manage
multiple seat-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) products? Take a break with
the Tenants feature in Cerby.

We’ve just released this feature to simplify user and access management. We
define tenants as applications where customers pay for the number of seats or
licenses instead of sessions that could be used by one or multiple users
simultaneously.

In seat-based apps, users belong to collaboration spaces (such as workspaces,
teams, and dashboards) with different roles and permissions, and admins manage
their access. For example, Apple, Asana, Atlassian, Calendly, or GitHub.

By adding a tenant and connecting it to Cerby, you can centrally and securely
manage all your colleagues from Cerby. That way, you only interact with one
user interface for multiple apps, and you can match users to your corporate
directory.

The following are the key benefits of Tenants:

  * Provision and deprovision users automatically in your apps.

  * Identify who uses your apps and their role, and match them to their profile in your corporate directory.

  * Manage users, roles, and account access from one interface.

  * Invite your colleagues to Cerby and secure their access to your app by complying with security best practices, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password rotation.

Check out the tenants you can add to Cerby, as shown in **Figure 1**.
