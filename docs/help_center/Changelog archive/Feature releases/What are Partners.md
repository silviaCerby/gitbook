# What are Partners?

**Description:** This article describes the key benefits of the Partners feature that enables you to share access to your accounts with external parties.

**Release date:** October 5, 2022

We know you do your best to find the safest way to share the credentials of
your apps when you collaborate with an external party. But what happens when
you lose control over your accounts? Here's where the Partners feature of
Cerby can help.

With security in mind, we've just released our Partners feature to enable you
to securely share accounts and collections with members who don't belong to
your domain, such as contractors, agencies, partners, vendors, and clients.

After establishing a partnership, partners can access these accounts through
Cerby without ever seeing, copying, and pasting (or memorizing, gasp!) your
username and password.

This feature gives you and your company complete control over the accounts and
visibility into their usage.

Check out the **Partners** view in your Cerby dashboard, as shown in **Figure
1**.

# What can you do with Partners?

With Partners, you can do the following:

  * Share accounts and collections with a guest workspace and remove access to them when needed.

  * Access shared accounts from the guest workspace.

  * Track activity on the shared accounts through the **Activity** view.

  * Leverage an **Account Manager** role able to ask the host workspace to share accounts with other members of the guest workspace.

# Can’t wait, let's start

If you are as excited as us about this new feature, here’s what you have to do
next:

  1. Make sure both the host and guest workspaces exist in Cerby.

  2. Establish a partnership via a request sent from the host workspace.

  3. Start sharing accounts with your partner.

partnership) article.

# Hold on. There's more?

Sit tight. Our Development team is currently working on the following features
to be released soon:

  * The ability to share a collection via a partnership

  * The ability to set an expiration date for the partnership
