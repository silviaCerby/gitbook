Available from your organization’s Okta Admin Dashboard {% endhint %}

As an Okta**Admin** , you can trigger Okta Universal Logout for a specific
user from the Okta Admin Dashboard. This action can be extended to Cerby,
triggering Cerby Universal Logout, which revokes the user’s sessions and
tokens in their Cerby-assigned apps and activates Cerby’s automated password
rotation for those apps.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Users must be created via SCIM for
the Universal Logout feature to work. {% endhint %}

To trigger Cerby’s Universal Logout from Cerby, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Log in to your organization's[ Okta Admin Console](https://developer.okta.com/login/).

  2. Select the **People** option under the **Directory** drop-down from the left navigation drawer. The **People** page is displayed.

  3. Select the user whose session you want to terminate.

  4. Click the **More actions** button. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  5. Select the **Clear User Sessions** option. The **Clear sessions and revoke access** dialog box is displayed and confirms that all of the user’s sessions and tokens will be revoked for the apps assigned to them in Okta.

  6. Select the **Also include logout enabled apps and Okta API tokens** checkbox, as shown in **Figure 1**.
