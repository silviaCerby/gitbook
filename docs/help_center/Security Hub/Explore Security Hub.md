# Explore Security Hub

**Description:** This article describes the key benefits of the Security Hub feature, which offers a central view of the health and status of the accounts in your workspace.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , and **Admins** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {%
endhint %}

With our Security Hub, you get a centralized view of the current health and
status of all accounts, enabling you to stay on top of any issues that might
compromise the security of your workspace. By aggregating data and presenting
it in a single, user-friendly dashboard, the Security Hub highlights any risky
behavior and misconfigurations in your workspace accounts so you can take
action as follows:

  * Spot and address potential vulnerabilities before they escalate.

  * Make proactive decisions.

  * Reduce the likelihood of breaches and keep your workspace safe.

In the first version of the Security Hub, **orphan accounts** are the primary
focus, and the only card is currently displayed in the dashboard. This feature
helps you quickly identify any accounts that should be assigned to one or more
**Owners**. Refer to the article [Assign Owners to orphan accounts in your
workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10580392-assign-owners-to-
orphan-accounts-in-your-workspace) to learn more about orphan accounts.

**Figure 1** displays the initial version of the Security Hub view,
highlighting the total number of accounts and the number of orphan accounts
within the workspace.
