# Log in to accounts shared via a host-guest partnership

**Description:** This article describes how to log in to the accounts you shared with a guest workspace via a host-guest partnership.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Users** *
Available to Cerby Automate * Supported using the Cerby web app, browser
extension, and mobile app {% endhint %}

All guest workspace members with shared access to accounts from the host
workspace can log in to these accounts through Cerby, regardless of their role
(**Collaborator** or **Manager**).

Access the accounts as you normally would via the account cards in the
dashboard of the Cerby web app, browser extension, and mobile app.

In the Cerby web app dashboard, the accounts shared via a host-guest
partnership are displayed in the **All accounts** view with the initial letter
of the workspace name beside the app logo, as shown in **Figure 1**.
