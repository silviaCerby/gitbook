**Description:** This article describes how to remove members from a guest workspace.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Admins** *
Available to Cerby Automate * Only supported using the Cerby web app {%
endhint %}

As a guest workspace **Admin** who has accepted a host-guest partnership, you
can remove users in the following two methods depending on the workspace type
and settings:

  * Automatically from your IdP

  * Manually from a local user workspace 

The following sections describe each method.

# Automatically from your IdP

When user provisioning is enabled in your Cerby workspace through the System
for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification from an identity
provider (IdP), such as Okta or Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), any change in
the corporate directory propagates automatically to your workspace.

IT admins can remove users from the IdP, which causes the corresponding
removal in a guest workspace. This action also involves removing all access to
accounts shared via a host-guest partnership.

# Manually from a local user workspace

When you have your Cerby guest workspace configured as a local user workspace,
user removal is manual through the **All members** view of the Cerby web app
dashboard. Follow the instructions from the [Remove user from
workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8011381-how-to-create-and-
configure-a-local-user-workspace#h_b382e5cb94) section of the article [How to
create and configure a local user
workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8011381-how-to-create-and-
configure-a-local-user-workspace).
