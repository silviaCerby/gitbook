As an account **Owner** from the host workspace, you can accept or decline an
access request for an account shared with a guest workspace via a host-guest
partnership.

To accept the request and share access to the account, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

**NOTE:** You can also click the **Open in Cerby** button from the access
request email you received, which will redirect you to the account details
page with the **Members** tab activated. You can continue in step 3.

  2. Click the **Settings** icon of the corresponding account card. The account details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.

  3. Activate the **Members** tab. A table with account members is displayed. Members with a pending request are displayed with the **Decline** and **Accept** buttons in the **Status** column.

  4. Click the **Accept** button of the corresponding account member. A success message box is displayed, and the account card is displayed in the Cerby dashboard of the corresponding guest workspace member.
