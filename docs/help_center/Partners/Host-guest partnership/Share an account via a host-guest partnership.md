**Description:** This article describes how to share access to your accounts with a guest workspace via a host-guest partnership.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * **Partnership Owners**

endhint %}

As a **Partnership Owner** from the host workspace, you can share access to
your accounts with a guest workspace via a host-guest partnership.

By default, the only user in the guest workspace who receives shared access to
your accounts is the guest workspace **Admin** , and you can assign them the
**Collaborator** or **Manager** role. With the **Manager** role, they can
request access to these accounts for other guest workspace members. For more
information, read the article [Request access to an account shared via a host-
guest partnership](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9044773-request-access-
to-an-account-shared-via-a-host-guest-partnership).

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** You can only share via a host-guest
partnership the accounts to which you have the **Owner** role. {% endhint %}
