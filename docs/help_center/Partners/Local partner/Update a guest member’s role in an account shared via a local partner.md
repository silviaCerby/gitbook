As a **Host Admin** of an existing [local
partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2), you can update a guest member’s role in an account you
shared via a local partner. This update doesn’t affect the role of **Guest
Admins** and **Guest Users** at the local partner level.

To update a guest member’s role in an account shared via a local partner, you
must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1655793560/eb9d1039ed8e9be650114599a8e3/AD_4nXcRXuZlqpWdtuRcbhBeIeUfl_5B0VnA7hHgYhRlZLlQllTLtgyvrcb55rwcAZYzy9YU_xRVvAKy46UM_gBLMP9ADO_qp8amFp-hX7ZeE_7BtkD5COF05wt_AyRzRORGxqs0smXgFtgeGkOBlr9xJ04mBYY?expires=1754441250&signature=0460ea33e1d8dbb4bba03753eda03741679d420334d855c41dd6beda8ff013dc&req=dSYiE853noRZWfMU3HP0gMCJsJkJCxVXLR1IuRr9NlS%2FseeTqGE%3D%0A)) icon that appears when hovering over the corresponding account card. A drop-down menu is displayed. 

  3. Select the **View Members** option from the menu. The account details page is displayed with the **Users** tab activated.

  4. Activate the **Guest users** tab. A table of **Guest Users** with shared access to your account is displayed. 

  5. Click the role of the corresponding **Guest User**. A side drawer is displayed with the current role of the user and a list of the different role assignments they have been granted on the account.

  6. Select the user’s new role from the **Role** drop-down:

     * **Account Manager:** Users can log in to the shared accounts and share access to these accounts with other **Guest Users**.

     * **Account Collaborator:** Users can only log in to the shared accounts.

  7. Click the **Apply** button. The side drawer closes, and a success message box is displayed. 

Now you are done.
