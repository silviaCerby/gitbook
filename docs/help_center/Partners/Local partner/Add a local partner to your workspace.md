As a workspace**Owner** , **Super Admin** , or **Admin** , you can add a
[local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2) to your Cerby workspace to streamline collaboration
with external parties, such as contractors, agencies, vendors, and clients.

A local partner is a subgroup or organization of guest users inside your
workspace to which you can grant access to the accounts they need for
collaboration. Additionally, you can delegate the work of inviting guest users
to an external collaborator by assigning them the **Guest Admin** role.
