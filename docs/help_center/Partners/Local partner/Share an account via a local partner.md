app {% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** of an existing [local
partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2), you can share the accounts you own via a local partner
to streamline collaboration with external parties. As part of the sharing
process, you need the involvement of a **Guest Admin** to propagate access to
your accounts for other **Guest Users**.

By default, the only users on the local partner who receive shared access to
your accounts are the **Guest** **Admins** , to whom you can assign the
**Collaborator** or **Manager** role. With the **Manager** role, they can
share access to these accounts with other **Guest Users**.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** **Host Admins** can only share the
accounts to which you have the **Owner** role. {% endhint %}

To share an account via your local partner, you must complete the following
main steps:

  1. Share an account with a local partner

  2. Share an account with a Guest User

The following sections describe each main step.
