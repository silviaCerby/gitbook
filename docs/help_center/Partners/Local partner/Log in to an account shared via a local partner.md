{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * **Guest Admins** and

browser extension, and mobile app {% endhint %}

All **Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** with access to accounts shared via a
[local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2) can log in to these accounts through Cerby, regardless
