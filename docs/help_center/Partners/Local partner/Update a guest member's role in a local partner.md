  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.

  3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.

  4. Activate the **Users** tab. The partner’s members and their roles are displayed.

  5. Click the role of the user you want to update. A drop-down menu is displayed with the following options:

     * **Guest User:** They can only view and receive access to accounts that a **Host Admin** shares with the local partner.

     * **Guest Admin:** They can invite and share items with other **Guest Users** to whom they were granted the account **Manager** role.
