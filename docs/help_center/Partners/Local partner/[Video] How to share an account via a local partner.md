# [Video] How to share an account via a local partner

**Description:** This video shows how to share an account with guest users via a local partner.

# **Key concepts**

  * Only **Host Admins** of an existing [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2) can share the accounts they own with a local partner for collaboration purposes.

  * By default, the only users on the local partnerâ€™s side who receive shared access to the accounts are the **Guest Admins** , who can be assigned any of the following two roles:

    * **Collaborator: Guest Admins** can only log in to the accounts through Cerby.

    * **Manager: Guest Admins** can log in to the accounts through Cerby and share access to them with other **Guest Users** ; they cannot manage the account details.

The process of sharing an account via a local partner comprises two main steps
performed by different users:

  1. Share an account with a local partner

  2. Share an account with a guest user

The following sections contain the videos of each main step.
