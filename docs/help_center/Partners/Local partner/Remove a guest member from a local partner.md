{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * **Host Admins**
and**Guest Admins** of a local partner * Only supported using the Cerby web
app {% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** or **Guest Admin** of a [local
partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2), you can remove a **Guest Admin** or **Guest User**
from an existing local partner, which also causes them to be removed from the
Cerby workspace.

The following rules apply when removing a guest member:

  * **Host Admins** can remove **Guest Users** and **Guest Admins**.

  * **Guest Admins** can only remove **Guest Users** , and they cannot remove themselves.

  * Accounts shared through the local partner are not affected.

To remove a guest member from a local partner, you must complete the following
steps:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.

  3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.

  4. Activate the **Users** tab. The partnerâ€™s members and their roles are displayed.

  5. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1655755551/3b66f8b06420290546bbb7dca7d9/AD_4nXcRXuZlqpWdtuRcbhBeIeUfl_5B0VnA7hHgYhRlZLlQllTLtgyvrcb55rwcAZYzy9YU_xRVvAKy46UM_gBLMP9ADO_qp8amFp-hX7ZeE_7BtkD5COF05wt_AyRzRORGxqs0smXgFtgeGkOBlr9xJ04mBYY?expires=1754439000&signature=75fcfd526e1c2f6e64463aded9a6103135ac2c90636d689495c039b689693deb&req=dSYiE857mIRaWPMU3HP0gH76Y8shsawP95bkrAgnSsfqTZ9%2FWuA%3D%0A)) icon on the right side of the corresponding user. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  6. Select the **Remove** option. The **Remove user?** dialog box is displayed.

  7. Click the **Remove user** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed. The user is removed from the local partner and the workspace.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** **Guest Admins** are the only ones who can
propagate access to the accounts that **Host Admins** share with the local
partner. So, make sure to designate a **Guest Admin** if you want to share
more accounts with **Guest Users** through a local partner. {% endhint %}

Now you are done.
