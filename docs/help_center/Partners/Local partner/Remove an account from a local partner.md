As a **Host Admin** of an existing [local
partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2), you can remove an account from a local partner that
you had shared previously. With this removal, all **Guest Admins** and **Guest
Users** with shared access to the account lose access.

To remove an account from a local partner, you must complete the following
steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.

  3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.

  4. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1655799529/3842b76f0c091b267cdf3c62a6f6/AD_4nXcRXuZlqpWdtuRcbhBeIeUfl_5B0VnA7hHgYhRlZLlQllTLtgyvrcb55rwcAZYzy9YU_xRVvAKy46UM_gBLMP9ADO_qp8amFp-hX7ZeE_7BtkD5COF05wt_AyRzRORGxqs0smXgFtgeGkOBlr9xJ04mBYY?expires=1754441700&signature=81974377e3438f32d23a751e928e981dc6f4b7567ca79752a3b9a64bd6bd1d4f&req=dSYiE853lIRdUPMU3HP0gM9GC%2BlXE%2BxVuvV1s%2BFEkJxL519Nfn0%3D%0A)) icon on the right side of the corresponding account.

Cerby removes access to all **Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** with shared
access to the account.
