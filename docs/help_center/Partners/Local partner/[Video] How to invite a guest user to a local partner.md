# **Key concepts**

  * **Host Admins** and **Guest Admins** of an existing [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2) can start inviting guest users to a workspace for collaboration purposes.

  * After sending the invite via email, guest users must open the invite and set up their account to join the Cerby workspace. For instructions, see the video [How to join a local partner as a guest user](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11513091-video-how-to-join-a-local-partner-as-a-guest-user).

  * A **Host Admin** can share accounts and secrets with a local partner and assign the **Collaborator** or **Manager** role to the **Guest Admin**. With the **Manager** role, **Guest Admins** can share access to the items with other guest users. For instructions on sharing items with guest users, see the video [How to share an account via a local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11511608-video-how-to-share-an-account-via-a-local-partner).

  * After joining a workspace, the access of all **Guest Users** is managed by **Guest Admins**. For more information, read the article [Manage a local partnerâ€™s guest members](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9039128-manage-a-local-partner-s-guest-members).
