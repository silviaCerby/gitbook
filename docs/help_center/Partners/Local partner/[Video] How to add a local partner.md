# [Video] How to add a local partner

**Description:** This video shows how to add a local partner to your workspace for collaboration with external parties.

# **Key concepts**

  * A [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2) enables you to create a subgroup or organization of guest users inside your workspace to grant them access to the accounts they need for collaboration. Additionally, you can delegate the work of inviting guest users to an external collaborator by assigning them the **Guest Admin** role.

  * Only workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins** can add a local partner to a workspace, assign the **Host Admin** role to a workspace member, and invite a **Guest Admin** to join the workspace. For more information about roles, read the article [How Cerby manages roles](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8500649-how-cerby-manages-roles#h_49944f20ce).

  * The**Guest Admin** must join your workspace from the email invite sent after adding the local partner. For instructions, see the video [How to join a local partner as a guest user](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11513091-video-how-to-join-a-local-partner-as-a-guest-user). 

  * As a **Host** or **Guest Admin** , you can invite additional guest users to a local partner. For instructions, see the video [How to invite a guest user to a local partner.](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11511600-video-how-to-invite-a-guest-user-to-a-local-partner)

  * Only **Host Admins** can share the accounts they own with a local partner and assign the **Collaborator** or **Manager** role to the **Guest Admin**. With the **Manager** role, **Guest Admins** can propagate shared access to the accounts with other guest users.
