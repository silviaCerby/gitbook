access to your app, enabling you to perform the following tasks:

  * Add users and teams to your app

  * Remove users and teams from your app

  * Update user roles

  * Protect your user accounts

  * Match and exempt users 

  * Download the list of users in a CSV file

The **Users** tab, as shown in **Figure 1** , groups users and teams into two
independent tables, each with relevant details to help you manage access
efficiently.
