# [Video] How to connect an App

**Description:** This video shows how to connect an App integration to Cerby to centrally manage the users and assets of your seat-based and paid social apps

# **Key concepts**

  * With an App integration, you can import to Cerby and sync the following user data from your seat-based and paid social apps:

    * Members or users

    * Native partners

    * Roles and permissions

    * Assets, such as ad accounts, pages, and pixels 

  * Cerby Apps are connected to your collaboration spaces (workspaces, dashboards, or teams) via an integration based on application programming interfaces (APIs) and agents built by Cerby.

  * The following are the requirements to connect your app to Cerby:

    * An automation account, meaning an active user account with a native admin role in the seat-based or paid social app

**NOTE:** Cerby recommends having a dedicated account for this purpose, not
intended for human use

    * A business or organization ID  
â€‹**NOTE:** Not all the **Apps** require a business or organization ID; Cerby
displays this input field when applicable to your app. For instructions on how
to find the ID, read the
[Requirements](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831152-how-to-use-
tenants#h_6b9e507d45) section of the article [How to use
Tenants](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831152-how-to-use-tenants).
