# Extend your Cerby accounts to Devolutions RDM

**Description:** This article describes how to integrate Cerby with Devolutions to view and manage your accounts using Remote Desktop Manager (RDM) on MacOS.

Cerby provides a seamless and secure solution for extending your accounts to
the Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager (RDM) dashboard.

With Cerby’s RDM integration, you can manage your Cerby accounts directly
within RDM while maintaining Cerby’s security practices. This integration is
achieved using the Cerby CLI, which must be installed and running locally on
your MacOS system. The CLI ensures that Cerby can verify your device's trusted
session, retrieve your locally encrypted accounts, and securely decrypt them.

RDM is a platform that centralizes and simplifies the management of remote
connections, credentials, and sensitive information because it supports a wide
range of connection types, including RDP, VPN, SSH, and more. After
integrating RDM with Cerby, you can sync your Cerby accounts through RDM
entries and manage them through the RDM dashboard.

After you have extended a Cerby account to RDM, you can perform the following
actions:

  * View password

  * Copy username and password

  * Copy account details

  * Log in to your account

This document describes how to integrate Cerby with Devolutions RDM.
