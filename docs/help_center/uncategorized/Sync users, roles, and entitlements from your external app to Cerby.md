As an integration **Owner** , you can trigger a sync to identify and import
user, role, and entitlement changes from your external app to Cerby.

Cerby recommends triggering these syncs after manually updating users'
assignments in the Cerby-integrated app to ensure the most current data is
imported. User, role, and entitlement changes are automatically applied to
Cerby during a sync.

To sync the user, role, and entitlements from your external app to Cerby, you
must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Integrations** option from the left menu. The **Integrations** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1586557793/6ae48ff3eebcad0460e7e856abf6/AD_4nXeeGJZmzwaS-SRUr4CcvXA1PA3rISj09RcmqDq85HoPba8eNIqf_R3tEAQLnllWdWILc1Bqh27pzMZyY8U-YoVbHP4ySRBvsA4AaWgWOVhb9ZQEVfVl1HbwHEUl3rKefAJYLA_HjA?expires=1750794750&signature=ac069e6373607cfba95ec364da076c0579cf598c4c45d028830f3b7998919318&req=dSUvEMx7moZWWvMU3HP0gEKSnd5qx2VJe8DDSlPHrOEBG4K5fmw%3D%0A)) icon of the corresponding integration. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  5. Click the **Sync** button located at the top right of the page.

of users. When the process is complete, a success message box is displayed.

Now you are done.
