already have shared access to the collection are automatically granted access
to the asset with the collection-level role.

the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.
