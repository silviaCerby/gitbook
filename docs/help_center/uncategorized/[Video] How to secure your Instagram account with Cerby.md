# [Video] How to secure your Instagram account with Cerby

**Description:** This video shows how to secure access to your Instagram account with authentication and verification methods managed by Cerby.

# **Key concepts**

  * Cerby will be set up as an authenticator app for multi-factor authentication (MFA), providing verification codes each time you or your coworkers with shared access log in to your Instagram account.

  * A Cerby-managed email address and phone number will be associated with your Instagram account to streamline login and automation tasks.

  * For instructions on how to add a guest user and how guest users can join and log in to your workspace, read the article [How to invite a guest user to your workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8392946-how-to-invite-a-guest-user-to-your-workspace).

  * Cerby recommends logging in to your Instagram account a few days before securing it with Cerby to make sure Instagram recognizes your device as trusted.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Take the following into consideration
for a successful setup: * Make sure you turn off the current MFA setup on
Instagram. For instructions, read the article [​​Securing your Instagram
account with two-factor
authentication](https://help.instagram.com/566810106808145). * Retain access
to the phone number previously associated with your account because sometimes
Instagram sends verification codes via SMS to these numbers. * Wait 24 hours
to make additional setting changes if Instagram limits access temporarily to
your account. {% endhint %}
