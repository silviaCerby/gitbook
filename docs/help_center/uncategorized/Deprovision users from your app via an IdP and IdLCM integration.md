# Deprovision users from your app via an IdP and IdLCM integration

**Description:** This article describes how to remove users from your external apps via an IdP and IdLCM integration.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * IT admins with a
tenant in an identity provider * Integration **Owners** * Only supported using
the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As an IT admin collaborating with an integration **Owner** , you can
deprovision users from your external apps via your identity provider (IdP) and
an IdLCM integration.

After connecting an integration to your IdP, such as Okta or Entra ID, you can
centralize user deprovisioning in your IdP. By establishing a SCIM connection,
Cerby automatically detects when users are removed from an IdP app
integration, either individually or through a group, triggering the automation
jobs to propagate these changes to the external app.

# Requirements

The following are the requirements to deprovision a user from your external
apps via an IdP and IdLCM integration:

  * A user account in your IdP with privileges to manage an app integration.

  * An IdLCM integration connected to your IdP to which you have the **Owner** role. For more information, read the article [Create an IdLCM integration for your app](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11643479-create-an-idlcm-integration-for-your-app).

# Deprovision users from your app via an IdP and IdLCM integration

To deprovision users from your external app via an IdP and IdLCM integration,
you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to the IdP admin console or center of your organization.

  2. Remove users from the app integration. For instructions, read the official documentation of your IdP:

     * **Okta:**

       * [Deprovision a user](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/provisioning/lcm/lcm-deprovision-user.htm)

       * [Unassign users from applications](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-unassign-apps.htm)

An automation job to deprovision users is triggered by Cerby.  
**TIP:** You can view the progress of the provisioning request in the
integration **Activity** tab.

Now you are done.
