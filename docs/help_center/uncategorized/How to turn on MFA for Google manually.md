# How to turn on MFA for Google manually

**Description:** This article describes how to manually turn on MFA for Google using Cerby as an authenticator.

The Cerby platform has a central feature that enables users to automatically
turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their application accounts. This
feature adds an extra layer of security to authentication processes.

However, not all applications support automation for turning on MFA from
Cerby. In these cases, users must manually configure MFA in the platforms of
their service providers.

This article describes the steps to manually configure and turn on MFA for
Google using Cerby as an authenticator.

# **Requirements**

The following are the requirements to configure MFA for Google:

  * A Google account added to Cerby

  * An active account on Google

  * A Cerby-managed phone number configured in your Google account. For detailed instructions, review the [How to add a Cerby-managed email or phone number to your account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6393770-video-how-to-add-a-cerby-managed-email-or-phone-number-to-your-account) video

**NOTE:** Cerby recommends turning on MFA using a browser on a desktop
computer.
