# Explore Push Notifications

**Description:** This article describes the benefits of enabling Cerby’s push notifications in your browser to get recent updates and requests.

With Cerby’s push notifications, you can receive real-time alerts directly in
your Cerby dashboard. When you enable this feature, Cerby immediately notifies
you whenever a new trusted device is added to your workspace, enabling you to
approve or deny access with just a single tap, ensuring you're always in
control.  
  
The following are some of the benefits you get by turning on push
notifications:

  * **Immediate visibility:** Get a prompt notification when a device is onboarded, rather than discovering it later through your profile.

  * **One-tap approval:** Review the device details and approve or reject new trusted devices directly from the notification.

**NOTE:** At the moment, Cerby shows notifications when onboarding a new
trusted device.

# **How push notifications work**

With Cerby’s push notifications, the process to onboard a new trusted device
is simplified as follows:

  1. Turn on push notifications in your Cerby dashboard.

  2. When Cerby detects an onboarding request from an unrecognized device, it automatically sends you a push notification directly to your Cerby dashboard, as shown in **Figure 1**.

  3. Click the notification buttons to approve or reject the new device:

     * **Approve:** Adds the device to your trusted list and finishes onboarding.

     * **Deny:** Rejects the onboarding of the new device and keeps its session as not trusted.

And, that’s it.
