# Update user assignments in your app via an IdP and IdLCM integration

**Description:** This article describes how to update users assigned to your external apps via an IdP and IdLCM integration

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * IT admins with a
tenant in an identity provider * Integration **Owners** * Only supported using
the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As an IT admin collaborating with an integration **Owner** , you can update
users and groups in your external apps from your identity provider (IdP)
through an IdLCM integration.

After connecting an integration to your IdP, such as Okta or Entra ID, you can
centralize user updates in your IdP. By establishing a SCIM connection, Cerby
automatically detects changes to users assigned to an IdP app integration,
such as changes on custom attributes, triggering the automation jobs to
propagate these changes to the external app.

     * **User groups:**

       1. Add users or members to the groups assigned to the integrated app with the role you want them to have. For instructions, read the official documentation of your IdP:

       2. Remove the users or members from the old group. For instructions, read the official documentation of your IdP:

          * **Okta** : [Remove people from a group](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-remove-group-people.htm)
