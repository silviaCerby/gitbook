# [Video] How to secure your X (Twitter) account with Cerby

**Description:** This video shows how to secure access to your X (Twitter) account with authentication and verification methods managed by Cerby.

# **Key concepts**

  * Cerby will be set up as an authenticator app for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide verification codes each time you or your coworkers with shared access log in to your X (Twitter) account.

  * A Cerby-managed email address and phone number will be associated with your X account to streamline login and automation tasks.

  * Make sure you have turned off MFA.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Whenever you make changes to your
account settings in X, such as updating your associated email address and
phone number, the change takes 24 hours to propagate. During that time, your
account settings will be restricted, so you will have to wait to make
additional changes. {% endhint %}
