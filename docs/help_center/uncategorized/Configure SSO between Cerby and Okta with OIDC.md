# Configure SSO between Cerby and Okta with OIDC

**Description:** This article describes how to configure Okta to enable SSO authentication for your new Cerby workspace using OIDC.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can configure this feature?** *
Workspace**Owners** {% endhint %}

With Cerby, you can configure Okta as your primary identity provider (IdP) to
leverage single sign-on (SSO) authentication for your organization.

When you create a new Cerby workspace (therefore, becoming the
workspace**Owner**), you can configure an OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration
for it. With this integration, all the users assigned to the Cerby application
in your Okta tenant can use their Okta login credentials to securely
authenticate to Cerby.

This article describes how to configure Okta as the primary IDP for your Cerby
workspace to enable SSO authentication using an OIDC integration.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** Currently, the configuration involves
creating an app integration in Okta from scratch. To simplify the
configuration, our Development team is working on adding a single OIDC and
SCIM app integration for Cerby to the Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog.
{% endhint %}

* * *

# **Supported features**

The following are the supported features of an Okta OIDC integration:

  * **Service provider-initiated authentication flow.** This authentication flow occurs when users attempt to log in to the app through their Cerby workspace.

  * **Automatic user account creation in Cerby.** This provisioning flow in Cerby occurs automatically on the initial SSO.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** OIDC-based workspaces don’t currently
support guest users. This feature will be available in future releases. {%
endhint %}

* * *

# **Requirements**

The following are the requirements to perform the configuration:

  * Okta

    * An Okta tenant

    * A user account in Okta with privileges to manage an app integration

    * Users and groups created beforehand in your Okta directory. Follow the corresponding instructions in the Okta Help Center to manage users and groups:

      * [Manage users](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-people.htm)

      * [Manage groups](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-groups-main.htm)

**NOTE:** When pushed to the app integration for Cerby, Okta groups become
Cerby [teams](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6624225-how-to-use-teams).

  * Cerby

    * An invite to create a workspace emailed by the Cerby Customer Support team  
​**IMPORTANT:** If you have not received an invite, send an email to
[support@cerby.com](mailto:support@cerby.com) with your request

    * A user account in Cerby with the workspace**Owner** role  
​**NOTE:** You automatically become the **Owner** when you log in to your
Cerby workspace after creating and configuring it

# **Configure SSO between Cerby and Okta with OIDC**

To configure SSO between Cerby and Okta with an OIDC integration, you must
complete the following main steps:

  1. Create a Cerby workspace

  2. Create an OIDC app integration in Okta

  3. Assign users and groups to the OIDC app integration in Okta 

  4. Configure the OIDC integration in Cerby

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** Depending on the use case, you may be
redirected to Okta for authentication if a session has not been established.
{% endhint %}

The following sections describe each main step.

## **1\. Create a Cerby workspace**

To create a Cerby workspace, complete the following steps:

  1. Click the **Create my workspace** button in the invitation email you received from Cerby. The **Welcome to Cerby** page is displayed in a new browser tab, as shown in **Figure 1**.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Keep the **Configure SSO between
Cerby and Okta with OIDC** page open because it contains the required values
that you must enter in Okta to complete the configuration. {% endhint %}

The next step is 2\. Create an OIDC app integration in Okta, which you must
complete in Okta.

Now you are done.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Currently, after creating a
workspace, you cannot change its name or update the IdP settings. {% endhint
%}{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE 1:** Users and groups assigned to the OIDC
app integration in Okta can now access their Cerby workspace with SSO
authentication through the corresponding tile in their Okta dashboard. In
Cerby, user accounts are automatically created after the initial SSO login. {%
endhint %}{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE 2:** The OIDC-based integration
leverages Okta only for authentication. To assign permissions within the Cerby
workspace, users must do so directly in the Cerby platform. {% endhint %}
