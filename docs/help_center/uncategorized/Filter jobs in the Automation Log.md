As a workspace **Owner** , **Super** **Admin** , or **Admin** , you can narrow
down the jobs displayed in the [Automation
Log](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11642287-explore-the-automation-log)
by applying the filters on the top menu.

These filters help you isolate specific automation jobs based on job type,
status, and app. Filtering enables you to monitor large activity volumes,
troubleshoot issues, or review recent identity, access, and account management
changes.

To filter jobs in the Automation Log, you must complete the following steps
using the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Automation** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Automation Log** page is displayed.

  3. Apply any of the following filters located at the top of the page:

       * **Running:** If a single nested job is still running.

       * **Started:** If nothing is running, but at least one nested job has started.

       * **Queued:** It is the default state if no jobs have started.

       * **Completed:** Only if all nested jobs are finished successfully.

     * **Filter by task:** The following are the tasks you can filter the results by:

       * **Adding users:** It involves creating a user account and inviting a new user to a seat-based or paid social app.
