As an integration **Owner,** you**** can access a comprehensive audit log with
full provisioning event details of an IdLCM integration.

The **Activity** tab, as shown in **Figure 1** , is a read-only log that
tracks all changes within an integration. It displays events related to user
and group management, SCIM gateway operations, and setup tasks to simplify
auditing, tracing, and troubleshooting.
