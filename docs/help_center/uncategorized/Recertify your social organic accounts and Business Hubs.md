# Recertify your social organic accounts and Business Hubs

**Description:** This video shows how the recertification process works for your social organic accounts and Business Hubs and how to recertify them.

# **Key concepts**

  * The Recertification process enables L'Oréal to verify that your organic accounts and Business Hubs are configured and protected according to the company’s security guidelines.

  * The social organic accounts and Business Hubs you must recertify are the following:

    * Meta (Instagram and Facebook)

    * TikTok

    * Pinterest

    * Snapchat

    * X (Twitter)

    * YouTube

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Take into consideration the following
notes: * Only **Owners** of an account or business hub can recertify them. *
**Collaborators** or guest users can’t see the recertification page. * If an
account has multiple **Owners** , all of them can see the recertification page
and complete it simultaneously. * Currently, no summary screen displaying all
recertified items and the progress of recertification is available. However,
if you need a detailed report for your DMI or market accounts and business
hubs, you can request an export from Cerby support at
[support@cerby.com](mailto:support@cerby.com). * If you encounter any issues
during the recertification process, feel free to contact Cerby support at
