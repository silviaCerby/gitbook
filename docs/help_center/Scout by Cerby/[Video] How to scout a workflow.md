# [Video] How to scout a workflow

**Description:** This video shows how to scout a workflow in the apps you use daily to help Cerby accelerate the automation building process.

# **Key concepts**

  * Scout by Cerby is a browser extension that accelerates and improves the building process of automated tasks. This extension captures how you interact with a web browser tab when performing the following manual business workflows:

    * Log in to your account

    * Update your account's password

    * Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA)

    * Invite a user to your app

    * Remove a user from your app

    * Update a user's role in your app

  * For workflow scouting tips and information about what data is captured, read the article [Explore Scout](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9774431-explore-scout).

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** To successfully use Scout, take the
following into consideration: * Make sure your organization was invited by
Cerby to access and install Scout through the Chrome Web Store. [Scout by
Cerby](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scout-by-
cerby/dknnopjbgccecedcmkfjlmenbagocmnh?authuser=1) is privately listed. * Make
sure you have generated an API key that enables you to log in to Scout and
send your scouting report to Cerby. Only workspace **Admins** and **Super
Admins** can generate an API key through the Cerby web app. This key must have
the following scopes: * **Read automated jobs** * **Write automated jobs** For
instructions, read the article [Generate an API
key](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9450943-generate-an-api-key). {%
