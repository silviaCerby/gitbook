# Migrate your items from your enterprise password manager to Cerby

**Description:** This article describes the key benefits of the Password Manager Importer feature to safely migrate your items from your EPM to Cerby.

With Cerby, you can seamlessly transition from a traditional enterprise
password manager (EPM) to our identity and access management platform with EPM
capabilities.

Our **Password Manager Importer** feature ensures a smooth and secure
migration from LastPass and 1Password to Cerby. Instead of manually saving
each corporate account, you can effortlessly sync and import all your items
into Cerby in one go.

Transitioning to Cerby offers significant advantages because we provide you
with robust security features such as our Zero Knowledge architecture and
multi-factor authentication (MFA) to confirm your identity when performing
high-sensitive actions.

We also facilitate interoperability across your organization's ecosystem by
integrating your workspace with your corporate Identity Provider (IdP), such
as Okta and Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), and enabling you to manage your
users, accounts, secrets, collections, business hubs, assets, and teams in a
centralized hub.

As part of your transition to Cerby, we offer you the **Import report** view
in your Cerby dashboard. This view is displayed after you import the folders,
vaults, and items from your password manager, as shown in **Figure 1**.

# What can you do with the Password Manager Importer?

With the Password Manager Importer, you can do the following:

  * Migrate from LastPass or 1Password to Cerby.

  * Select your LastPass folders and 1Password vaults to import them to Cerby as collections with all of the items inside them.

  * Import user access permissions for folders in LastPass and vaults in 1Password. For workspace members with an existing Cerby user account, these permissions automatically propagate to collections, accounts, and secrets.

  * Match LastPass and 1Password users automatically to their Cerby user account.

  * Keep a record of users who had access to your accounts through your EPM.
