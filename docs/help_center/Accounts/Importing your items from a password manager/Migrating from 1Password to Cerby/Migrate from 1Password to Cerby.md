# Migrate from 1Password to Cerby

**Description:** This article describes how to import your 1Password vaults and items to Cerby.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Cerby
Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users** * Only
supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a workspace user in Cerby, you can migrate your 1Password vaults and items
using our **Password Manager Importer** as their corresponding Cerby item
types:

  * Vaults become collections

  * Logins become accounts

  * Passwords become accounts

  * Secure notes become secrets

  * Software licenses become Software license secrets

  * Databases become Database secrets

  * Servers become Server secrets

  * Wireless routers become WiFi secrets

  * SSH keys become SSH key secrets

**NOTE:** For a detailed mapping between 1Password and Cerby items, read the
Item and field mapping section.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** As per our current support, the
Password Manager Migrator does not migrate 1Password Groups as Teams in Cerby.
{% endhint %}

Throughout the entire import process, Cerby maintains a secure, direct
connection with 1Password and facilitates a seamless import of its vaults and
items. The Password Manager Importer ensures uninterrupted continuity and
consistency in your data and user access to start managing your items through
Cerby.

* * *

# Requirements

The following are the requirements to use the **Password Manager Importer**
for 1Password:

  * A workspace in Cerby

  * A Cerby user account

  * An active 1Password business account 

**IMPORTANT:** During the migration, ensure that any single sign-on or two-
factor authentication methods are temporarily disabled in your 1Password
account. Currently, we only support authentication using your username and
password credentials in 1Password.

  * You must have the following permissions in 1Password that let Cerby access the vaults and items you want to import:

    * For vaults (full access)

      * Manage Vault

    * For items

      * View Items

      * Create Items

      * Edit Items

      * Archive Items

      * Delete Items

    * For client settings

      * Import Items

      * Export Items

      * Copy and Share Items

      * Print Items

    * For App Access, your account must have **1Password Command-Line Tool access** enabled.

  * The secret key that corresponds to your 1Password account. 

**NOTE:** You can find your secret key as follows:

    * In your 1Password Emergency Kit. This PDF file is commonly saved on the device you used to create your 1Password account.

    * In the 1Password desktop application. To get your secret key, you must complete the following steps:

      1. Click the user profile menu located at the top-left corner. A drop-down menu is displayed.

      2. Select the **Set Up Another Device** option. The **Set Up Another Device** dialog box is displayed, and the**Account Details** tab is activated.

      3. Click the **secret key** field. Your secret key is copied to the clipboard.

    * In the 1Password web version. To get your secret key, you must complete the following steps:

      1. Click the user profile menu located at the top-left corner. A drop-down menu is displayed.

      2. Select the **My Profile** option. The **My Profile** page is displayed.

      3. Hover the mouse over the **Secret Key** field. Two buttons are displayed.

      4. Click the **Copy** button. Your secret key is copied to the clipboard.

# Import rules

The following import rules have been established for 1Password:

  * All the imported vaults, supported accounts, and secrets are automatically onboarded to Cerby. In the import report, you can see if any details are missing and enter them if necessary.

  * Items are imported to the default vault in your workspace. Workspace**Admins** must ensure that a default local vault has been created and set up.

  * Empty 1Password vaults are imported to Cerby as empty collections. If the empty vaults are shared with other users in the account, the permissions are migrated into Cerby.

  * 1Password time-based shared items are not shared after being imported in Cerby.

  * The following rules are applied to duplicate items:

    * All secrets are imported to Cerby, and they are not identified as duplicates.

    * All selected vaults are imported and identified with a number at the end of their collection name. 

  * In 1Password, you can set up multiple Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) codes. However, during migration, the Password Manager Importer selects the first TOTP code it encounters.

  * 1Password login and password items might not be identified as managed accounts after migration in Cerby for the following reasons:

    * The application provider does not allow duplicated usernames.

    * The account was migrated without using the full URL, including the `https://` protocol, so the account is categorized as a self-managed account.

    * Multiple application providers share the same root domain.

  * 1Password access permissions are automatically granted to users with an active Cerby user account. After the import, you can invite users without a matching Cerby user account.

**NOTE:** Read more about how 1Password roles and permissions map to Cerby
roles in the Mapping of 1Password vault permissions and client settings
section.

**Table 1.** Corresponding 1Password item and field mapping in Cerby

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Consider the following for the items
with an asterisk (*) in **Table 1** : * Cerby’s Password Manager Importer
supports only one domain per 1Password login item. * Domain and website fields
in login and password 1Password items must have the `https:// `or `http://`
protocols. Items without these protocols are imported but recognized as self-
managed accounts. * Cerby does not support or migrate any 1Password item
fields not listed in**Table 1** ; therefore, you have to manually add them as
custom items or secrets after the import. {% endhint %}

# Mapping of 1Password vault permissions and client settings

Cerby’s Password Manager Importer replicates the 1Password sharing
permissions, mapping them to Cerby roles to ensure seamless transition,
consistent access control, and integrity of user permissions and access
levels.

detected a new sign-in to your account. This email is triggered by Cerby’s
connection to 1Password to retrieve the vault information.

  8. Click the **Add** icon from the **Discovered vaults** section that corresponds to the vault you want to import. The vault is added to a list in the **Selected vaults** section.

  9. Repeat step 8 as necessary. 

**TIP:** You can also use the search boxes in the **Discovered vaults** and
**Selected vaults** sections to look for vaults by name.

  10. Click the **Import** button. The dialog box closes, and the **Import Report** view is displayed with the “We’re importing your items from your password manager to Cerby” message.

**NOTE:** The process may take a few minutes, depending on the number of
vaults and items to import. When the import is complete, a success message box
is displayed, and an email is sent.

The next step is 2\. Review the import report, which you must complete from
the **Import Report** view.

## **2\. Review the import report**

The **Password Manager Importer** transfers to Cerby all the login, password,
secure note, software license, database, server, SSH key, and wireless router
items saved inside your 1Password vaults.

After an import, all of the transferred items are displayed on the **Import
report** view.

The **Import report** view contains the following sections:

  * **Collections:** It displays the number of 1Password vaults imported as collections to Cerby. 

  * **Accounts and Secrets:** It displays the number of 1Password items imported to Cerby. All accounts and secrets are **onboarded** to Cerby, even if they are duplicates or have details missing. 

  * **Users:** It displays the number of users whose Cerby user accounts were **matched** or**unmatched** to 1Password access permissions. You can download a CSV file with a table of unmatched users by clicking the **Download unmatched users report** button.

  * **Imported items:** It displays a table with the imported items in the following four tabs:

    * **Pending review: It displays the items with import issues.**

    * **Onboarded items: It displays the items onboarded to Cerby.**

    * **Unmatched users:** It displays the users who were not automatically matched and the items to which they still have access in 1Password.

    * **Matched users:** It displays the users matched to their Cerby user account and the items to which they have access through Cerby. 

You can download a full import report in a CSV file by clicking the **Download
latest report** button located at the top right of the **Import report** view.
This report contains a table with all the imported items (collections,
accounts, and secrets) and permissions to help you verify that your items were
successfully transferred from 1Password.

If you see items with the skipped or failed status, the report provides
information about why Cerby did not import them, and you can take action to
solve the issues.

# Invite unmatched users to Cerby

After an import from 1Password, unmatched users in the **Import report** view
need a direct share or an invite to access the imported collections, accounts,
or secrets. The invite process is different depending on the type of user:

  * Users with a Cerby account

  * Guest users

## **Users with a Cerby account**

Users who are part of your organization and have a Cerby account but are
unmatched need a direct share of the imported collections, accounts, and
secrets. Follow the corresponding instructions to share the items:

  * Collection

    1. Watch the video [How to create and share a collection](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6393791-video-how-to-create-and-share-a-collection).

  * Account

    1. Watch the video [How to share access to accounts with teammates](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5605252-video-how-to-share-access-to-accounts-with-teammates).

  * Secret

    1. Watch the video [How to add and share a secret](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/7321008-video-how-to-add-and-share-a-secret).

## **Guest users**

External collaborators who are not part of your organization and don’t have a
Cerby account are identified as unmatched. To grant them the imported access
permissions, you can invite them to join your workspace as guest users.

Guest users have identities and authentication managed by Cerby. After
receiving the invite and joining Cerby, they are visible through the **All
Members** view and searchable through the item-sharing dialog boxes. For more
information about this feature, read the [How to invite a guest user to your
workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8392946-how-to-invite-a-guest-
user-to-your-workspace) article.

To invite a guest user as part of the import process, you must complete the
following steps from the **Import report** view:

  1. Activate the **Unmatched users** tab.

  2. Click the **Invite as guest** button of the corresponding user. The **Invite guest user** dialog box is displayed.

  3. Click the **Send invite** button. The dialog box closes, a success message box is displayed, and the invite is sent to the guest user’s email.

The guest user must open the invite and set up their account to join your
Cerby workspace. For instructions, read the section [Join Cerby from a guest
user invite](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8392946-how-to-invite-a-guest-
user-to-your-workspace#h_b1d67dc2dc) from the article [How to invite a guest
user to your workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8392946-how-to-
invite-a-guest-user-to-your-workspace).

When they join Cerby, the corresponding shared items are displayed in the
**All Accounts** , **Secrets** , and **Collections** views.

# How to interpret the downloadable import report

When you download a full import report in CSV format after transferring your
items to Cerby, you can verify if all of your individual items were
successfully transferred from 1Password.

The table contains detailed information about the import status of every item
and permission. If an item is identified with the skipped or failed status,
the import report also describes why it was not imported so you can solve the
issue and try again.

The following glossary describes the terms used in the table:

  * **`Item type`:** It is a column header indicating the type of imported item: account, secret, collection, or permission.

  * **`Import status`:** It is a column header indicating the import status of an individual item: successful, skipped, or failed.

  * **`Status details`:** It is a column header indicating more information for interpreting the import status.

  * **`Item path`:** It is a column header indicating the vault name in 1Password.

  * **`Item name`:** It is a column header indicating the item name as it was saved in 1Password.

  * **`Item username`:** It is a column header indicating the username associated with the imported account. The permission item type indicates the role assigned to an imported collection.

  * **`Item URL`:** It is a column header indicating the URL associated with the imported account.

  * **`Username`:** It is a column header indicating the user’s associated username to whom a collection was assigned. It only applies to the permission item type.

  * **`Successful` (import status):** It is a status indicating the item was successfully imported from 1Password to Cerby.

  * **`Skipped` (import status):** It is a status indicating the item was intentionally omitted from the import. For more details, see the **Status** details column.

  * **`Failed` (import status):** It is a status indicating Cerby attempted to import the item but encountered issues. For more details, see the **Status** details column.

  * **`Empty_collection` (status details)**: It is a value indicating the collection was skipped during the import because the 1Password vault was empty.

  * **`Successful` (status details):** It is a value indicating the item was imported without issues.

  * **`Unknown_permission_error` (status details):** It is a value indicating the item import failed because of an unidentified error related to permissions, suggesting a potential issue with access rights.

  * **`User_not_found` (status details):** It is a value indicating the item import failed because Cerby could not find its associated user account, possibly due to a nonexisting account or identification mismatch.

The import report displays two sets of statuses and values that help you
determine a successful import for collections.

When you see a `collection` as the item type in the corresponding column and
the `successful` status and value, which means the 1Password vault was
imported to Cerby without any issues.

When you see `permission` as item type in the corresponding column and the
`successful` status and value, it means that the original user access
permission was assigned to the corresponding imported collection. You can
obtain additional information from the following columns:

  * The `Item path` column helps you identify the collection name.

  * The `Item name` column helps you identify the role (**Owner** or **Collaborator**) assigned to the imported collection.

  * The `Username` column helps you identify the user who received the access grant in Cerby to the collection.
