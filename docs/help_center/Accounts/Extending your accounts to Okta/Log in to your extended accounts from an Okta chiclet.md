# Log in to your extended accounts from an Okta chiclet

**Description:** This article describes how to access your accounts from chiclets in your Okta dashboard with Cerby’s automated login

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users** * Account**Owners**
and**Collaborators** * Only supported using the Cerby browser extension {%
endhint %}

As a user with any workspace role in Cerby, except the **Login-only** role,
you can log in to your Cerby accounts from your Okta dashboard when your
workspace has the **[Extended account
access](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9616265-explore-extended-account-
access)** feature enabled.

Account **Owners** must have already synced and extended their accounts for
the corresponding chiclets to be displayed on the Okta dashboard. For
instructions, read the article [Sync and extend an account to
Okta](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9759106-sync-and-extend-an-account-
to-okta).

Additionally, you must have the **Owner** or **Collaborator** role in such
extended accounts to see the chiclets in your Okta dashboard for logging-in
purposes.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** You must have already installed the
Cerby browser extension approved by your company. {% endhint %}

To log in to your accounts from a chiclet in your Okta dashboard, you must
complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your Okta dashboard.

  2. Click the corresponding chiclet or application from your Okta dashboard. Okta redirects you to the Cerby platform and authenticates you automatically if you don’t have an active session in Cerby.

The Cerby browser extension autofills your credentials, including verification
codes if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is on and managed by Cerby.

Now you are done.
