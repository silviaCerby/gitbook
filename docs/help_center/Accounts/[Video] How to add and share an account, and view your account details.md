# [Video] How to add and share an account, and view your account details

**Description:** This video shows how to add a new account to Cerby, share it with other workspace users, view your account details, and log in to your app

# Key concepts

  * Cerby uses the information you enter when adding an account to provide you with a seamless automatic login experience.

  * The user who adds an account becomes the Account Owner.

  * When sharing an account with other workspace users or teams, you can assign them one of two roles on the account:

    * Owner: Your colleagues can share the account with other users, edit the account details, and manage the account security. 

    * Collaborator: Your colleagues can only use the account to log in to the application.
