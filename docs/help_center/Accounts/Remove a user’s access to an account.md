**Description:** This article describes how to remove a user’s access to an account granted through an account, team, collection, or business hub.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace **Owners** ,
**Super** **Admins** , **Admins** , **Users** , and **Guest Users** * Account
**Owners** * Supported using the Cerby web app and mobile app {% endhint %}

As an account **Owner** , you can remove a user directly from the account if
their access was granted through the account itself. However, if the access
was granted through a team, collection, or business hub, you must be the
**Owner** of those items to remove the user’s access to the account.

To remove a user’s access to an account, you must follow the next steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Click the corresponding account card. The account details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.

  3. Activate the **Users** tab. The **User Overview** section is displayed with a table of users who have shared access to the account.

     * If the user has direct access to the account:

       1. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1568614892/9cd92f49bbeb8f2e4d47bb10958f/AD_4nXeHMC6yB89IZvXueGrfnlQWqZyjcnz-fUR6qSedCimXbWIQWp_KS8ETEi5CbGkBK4bJo6ZJOpCwnqCg_nxTnGXY0_lpa7xEfAyHOP-ySLAhKombLjz8uSvfjQA5bfhbfPUmE5loPQ?expires=1749765750&signature=f012dd284883fe3abd778a7b51ba941ce35d64d24697d2c1490e2f6f42794e9e&req=dSUhHs9%2FmYlWW%2FMU3HP0gA6NWEIkywA5xQJfpKCmxT1HAYSQq9Y%3D%0A)) icon next to the user’s details.

A menu is displayed.

       2. Click the **Go to teams** , **Go to collections** , or **Go to business hubs** option. 

          * If you have the **Owner** role, the team, collection, or business hub details page is displayed. You can remove the user’s access to the account directly from that page. 

          * If you don’t have the **Owner** role, an error page is displayed.

Now you are done.
