# [Video] How to turn on MFA in TikTok manually

**Description:** This article details how to turn on MFA manually for a TikTok account using the Cerby mobile and web applications.

**Key Concepts:**

  * Cerby recommends configuring email-based MFA for TikTok accounts using a Cerby-managed email.

  * If you have an already existing email configured on your TikTok account, you will need to off-board the existing email first. This involves receiving and confirming a code sent to the email on file. 

  * After a Cerby-managed email has been configured on the TikTok account, you will select "password" and "email" as the two factors for the TikTok account.
