# Forward a message from your Cerby inbox

**Description:** This article describes how to forward a message sent to the Cerby-managed email address created and set up for your accounts.

With Cerby, all the users within a workspace, no matter their role, have a
secure and centralized way to store and view the messages sent to the Cerby-
managed email addresses they create and set up for their accounts.

The Cerby inbox is a feature that enables you to perform some of the automated
tasks to log in to your accounts when a Cerby-managed email address is
configured as a verification method for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

However, in some cases, you or your colleagues may need to take action on the
messages. For example, when you are asked to verify a login attempt or want to
reply to the sender. In this scenario, you can forward the message to yourself
or your colleagues, and only to an email address linked to a Cerby account.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** The forward message feature is not
supported for SMS messages sent to Cerby-managed phone numbers. {% endhint %}
