# **Important considerations while onboarding apps**

The following are important considerations while onboarding social media
accounts in Cerby:

  * Perform any account configuration with the device you regularly use to log in.

  * Turn off MFA entirely on your account before turning it on with Cerby as an authenticator app.

    * Follow the steps in the article [How to turn on MFA managed by Cerby](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8429534-how-to-turn-on-2fa-managed-by-cerby) carefully to avoid having your account locked or in an inconsistent state.

  * Log in to your account from Cerby to verify that your password was correctly saved. You’d be surprised how easy it is to introduce an extra space when copying and pasting.

  * Some platforms might restrict you from making multiple changes to an account configuration in a short time. Don’t worry; restrictions are temporary, and you will regain access to your account configuration in a few days.

  * Beware of potential account restrictions due to the location of new logins

  * Whenever supported, turn on MFA with Cerby as an authenticator app. Avoid using SMS or email for MFA unless they are the only available method; in such a case, use a Cerby-managed phone number or email address.

  * When logging in automatically to an account from Cerby, don’t move your mouse or click anything else on your web browser until you are logged in. Interfering with the automation or navigating to another tab causes the login process to fail.

  * Pay attention to the in-context alerts in the top-right corner of the screen. If the automated login encounters an error, you can get helpful information from these alerts.
