# [Video] How to log in from the account login page

**Description:** This video covers how to login to your already added account from the account's login page.

**Key Concepts:**

  * If this is a [managed account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_f0a859b407), Cerby initiates an automated login from the login page of the account.

  * if this is a [self-managed account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_079d120056), you must populate each field using the Cerby browser extension.
