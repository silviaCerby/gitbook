As a secret or secret item (such as WiFi, SSH keys, database, server, and
custom item) **Owner** , you can update the role of other workspace members on
your items using the Cerby web app. To do so, you must complete the following
steps:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Secrets** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Secrets** view is displayed.

  3. Click the **Settings** (![](gitbook/imagesAD_4nXf2FA05fH4m3T-v2WGR-aFQMVNwMqXR43V88GGzKEldhJnIbW3RzzsP8GNd0AySCcatr_LEOf6dhVRXh-bwcD6r8hOFQl2YTySPdaPXYhdsQefPLtORPsGDxOv9Pxc35zeWSJhC8caWVU_3hBgMuDSbM0mR)) icon of the corresponding secret card. The secret details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.

**NOTE:** If an identity challenge is configured, the **Confirm your identity
to continue** dialog box is displayed, and a push notification is sent to your
Cerby mobile app:

     1. Confirm your identity by tapping the**It’s me!** button from the **Confirmation Request** screen of your Cerby mobile app. The **Confirm your identity to continue** dialog box closes in the Cerby web app, and the secret details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.

  4. Activate the **Members** tab. The **User Overview** section is displayed with a table of users who have shared access to the secret or secret item.

  5. Select the option from the **Cerby role** drop-down list that corresponds to the new role on the secret or secret item: 

     * **Owner:** Members can share access, edit, add attachments, and manage the secret settings.

     * **Collaborator:** Members can only view the secret and download the attachments.

**IMPORTANT:** Users who have received shared access to the same secret or
secret item multiple times appear with the **Mixed role** status in the
**Cerby role** column. When clicking the drop-down list, the **Share secret**
dialog box is displayed with each access grant and role. You can only update
the role if shared access is via a direct grant to the secret or a collection
to which you have the **Owner** role.

A success message box is displayed.

Now you are done.
