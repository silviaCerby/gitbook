As a user with any workspace role in Cerby, except **Guest User** and **Login-

users and assets (such as Facebook Pages and Ad accounts) of Meta Business
Manager (now Meta Business Portfolio).

When you connect the business hub, you become its **Owner** , and you can
perform the following user and access management tasks through automated tasks
and API calls executed by the Cerby agent:

  * Check for updates

  * Invite app members

  * Update app members’ roles

  * Remove app members

{% hint style="success" %} **TIP:** For more details about the automated tasks
of a business hub, how it works, and the supported apps, read the article
[Explore Apps](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831152-explore-apps). {%
endhint %}

Additionally, you can perform the following actions to manage access to your
Meta Business Manager for external collaborators:

  * Invite users to your workspace as [guest users](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8392946-how-to-invite-a-guest-user-to-your-workspace) or [local partners](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2), with secure credentials provided and managed by Cerby.

  * Connect a [native partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_e7fa9c355c) to your workspace to gain visibility on the partner’s users with shared access to the assets of your Meta Business Manager.

check for updates is performed, Cerby generates a report and sends business
hub **Owners** an email to confirm their removal from the app. For more
instructions, read the article [Check for updates in your app and apply
report](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9046205-check-for-updates-in-your-

**Admin** role in your Meta Business Manager; therefore, you must auto-claim
it. To do so, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Business Hubs** view is displayed.

  4. Activate the **Unmatched users** tab in the **User Overview** section.

  5. Auto-claim the **Owner** role on the business hub by completing the following steps:

     1. Click the **Match user** button that is displayed when you hover over the corresponding user from the table. The **Match user** dialog box is displayed.

     2. Enter your username or email address in the **Match with** search bar. A list of users that match your search is displayed.

     3. Select the corresponding option from the list.

     4. Click the **Next** button. The **Select Cerby role** dialog box is displayed.

     5. Select the **Owner** option from the drop-down list.

**App access** columns for your Cerby account. {% endhint %}

Cerby user accounts that correspond to their email addresses, including
existing [guest users](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8392946-explore-
guest-users), [local
partners](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_7e4add33a2), and [native
partners](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_e7fa9c355c). Manual matching is required when apps don't provide
email addresses and for app members using personal or external accounts that
couldn’t be identified or are not in the corporate directory.

To view the status of the imported app members, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Business Hubs** view is displayed.

A drop-down list is displayed.

  3. Select the **View Members** option from the list. The business hub details page is displayed with the **Members** tab activated.  
App members are displayed in the following tabs of the **User Overview**
section:

     * **Unmatched users:** This tab displays the users who were not automatically matched.

     * **Onboarded users:** This tab displays the users matched to their Cerby user account. 

     * **Guest users:** This tab displays the users who were matched to an existing Cerby user account but it doesn’t exist in the corporate directory, such as external collaborators.
