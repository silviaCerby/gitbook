# Remove users from your app via a business hub

**Description:** This article describes how to remove users of your seat-based and paid social apps via a business hub.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Business hub
**Owners** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can remove the users of your external seat-
based and paid social apps via an automated task triggered from Cerby.

This process involves removing user access to the business hub integration and
choosing to remove or keep the user’s seat in the external app.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** You cannot remove users individually
if they have shared access to a business hub integration through a team. In
this case, you must remove the users from the corresponding team. The
instructions are different depending on how the teams were created in Cerby: *
Self-managed teams * [Add or remove members from teams
manually](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6624225-how-to-use-
teams#h_4e263e9165) * IdP-managed teams * **Okta:** [Remove people from a

# **Important considerations**

While the instructions above provide a general guide for removing users,
outcomes can vary depending on how access was granted to the business hub
integration. The following are important considerations:

  * Users who keep shared access to the integration, whether individually or through another team, will not be removed from the external app. Based on all their existing access grants, Cerby might trigger an automated task to update their role in the external app and assets if supported.

  * To fully remove users’ access, make sure you review and remove all existing user and team access grants to the business hub integration.

  * Removals from the external app or the business hub _don’t_ affect user access to their Cerby workspace.
