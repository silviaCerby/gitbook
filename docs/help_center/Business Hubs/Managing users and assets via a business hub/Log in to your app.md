**Description:** This article describes how to log in to an app you have connected to Cerby.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * App
integration**Owners** and **Collaborators** * Available to Cerby Automate *

endhint %}

App integration **Owners** and **Collaborators** can log in to the app through
the app connected to their user account. Access is, as usual, via the
corresponding account card in the **All accounts** view.

However, when users have more than one user account for the same app, they can
select the account to use to log in by performing the following actions from
the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Apps** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Apps** view is displayed.

  3. Click the **Log in** icon of the corresponding app card. The **Choose an account to log in** dialog box is displayed with a list of user accounts.

  4. Click the **Log in** button of the corresponding user account.

A similar login process for users with multiple user accounts for the same app
is available in the Cerby browser extension. To log in, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace with the browser extension.

  2. Click the corresponding app card. A page with the name of your app is displayed with the account cards that correspond to each user account, as shown in **Figure 1**.
