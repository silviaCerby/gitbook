# **Important considerations**

While the instructions above provide a general guide for updating the role of
team members, outcomes can vary depending on how access was granted to the
external app. The following are important considerations:

  * The process of updating team members’ roles differs based on whether the external applications support weighted roles or not. Cerby manages these updates in the following ways:

    * If the external app supports weighted roles, Cerby triggers the automated task to update the role of team members when a higher role is assigned or the highest role is removed.

    * If the external app doesn’t support weighted roles, Cerby triggers an automated task to update the role of team members to reflect the latest assignment.
