As an App integration **Collaborator** who receives an invite to join a seat-
based or paid social app, you must accept the invite, create a user account in
the app, and connect this account to Cerby. To do so, invited users must
complete the following steps:

  1. Add your user account in Cerby by performing the following actions:

     1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

     2. Click the app card with the “Connect your account” status. The **Connect your account** dialog box is displayed.

     3. Select the **I haven’t created the account and want to protect my contact information by using a Cerby-managed identity** option.

     4. Click the **Next** button. We generate a secure password and, if required, a Cerby-managed phone number for MFA. The **Create <app name> account** dialog box is displayed.

**NOTE:** If you have already created the account in the app, update your
profile information in the app with the password and phone number we provided.

     5. Copy the password and phone number to paste them when you create the account in the app.

**IMPORTANT:** Leave the dialog box open to complete the process to add and
connect the account to Cerby.

  2. Create your account in the app by performing the following steps:

     1. Open the app by clicking the link in the invite email you received.

     2. Follow the instructions to create your account in the app using the password and phone number we provided.
