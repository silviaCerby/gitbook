# Add users and teams to your apps via a business hub

**Description:** This article describes how to add users and teams to your external seat-based and paid social apps via a business hub.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Business hub
**Owners** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can add users to your external seat-based
and paid social apps via an automated task triggered from Cerby.

The process of adding users involves sharing the business hub integration in
Cerby, and you can share it with one or multiple users and teams at the same
time.

During the share, you specify the role for both users and teams on the
business hub integration (**Owner** or **Collaborator**) and the native app
role (it varies according to the app), including assets if supported.

After completing the share, Cerby triggers an automated task to invite the
specified users and team members individually to join your external app.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** To start protecting and managing user
access from Cerby, the new users must accept the invite, create a user account
in the external app, and connect this account to Cerby. For instructions, read
the article [Join your external app and set up your business hub
access](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9046232-join-the-app-and-connect-
it-to-cerby). {% endhint %}

  11. Click the **Next** button. The **Define Access** dialog box is displayed.

  12. Select the option of the corresponding access level of the users on the app:

     * **Invite user to <app name>: **It means users can join the app with an assigned seat and manage the app settings in Cerby.

     * **Share only business hub in Cerby:** It means users can access and manage the app settings in Cerby without assigning a seat.  
​**NOTE:** The **Share only business hub in Cerby** access level is only
enabled when selecting Owner as the user’s role.

  13. Click the **Next** button. The**Define App Role** dialog box is displayed.

  14. Select the corresponding access role of the users and teams from the **Application Role** list.

     1. Click the **Next** button. The **Assign assets** dialog box is displayed.

     2. Select the assets you want to grant access to the users and teams.

     3. Select the role options you want to assign to the users and teams:

        * **Partial access:** It means users can only perform the selected actions on the asset.  
​**NOTE:** The actions that users and teams can perform on an asset differ
depending on the app.

        * **Full access:** It means users can perform all the supported actions on the asset.

  16. Click the**Share** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed. The new users and teams are displayed in the table in the**User Overview** section.

Cerby triggers an automated task to send invites via email to the users to set
up their account to join the app and connect their user account to Cerby.

Now you are done.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** If the automated task to send invites fails,
the corresponding app members are displayed with an **Invite failed** status,
and you must send the invites manually. For detailed instructions, read the
article [Troubleshooting: Add users to your app
manually](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9046236-troubleshooting-
