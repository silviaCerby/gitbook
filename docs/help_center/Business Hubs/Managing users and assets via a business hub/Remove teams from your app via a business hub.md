As a business hub **Owner** , you can remove the teams from your external
seat-based and paid social apps via an automated task triggered from Cerby.

This process involves removing team members' access to the business hub
integration in Cerby.

To remove a team from your external app via a business hub, you must complete
the following steps:

  1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Business Hub** option from the left menu. The **Business Hub** page is displayed.

  3.

Now you are done.

# **Important considerations**

While the instructions above provide a general guide for removing teams,
outcomes can vary depending on how access was granted to the business hub
integration. The following are important considerations:

  * Users who keep shared access to the integration, whether individually or through another team, will not be removed from the external app. Based on all their existing access grants, Cerby might trigger an automated task to update their role in the external app and assets if supported.

  * To fully remove users’ access, make sure you review and remove all existing user and team access grants to the business hub integration.

  * Removals from the external app or the business hub _don’t_ affect user access to their Cerby workspace.
