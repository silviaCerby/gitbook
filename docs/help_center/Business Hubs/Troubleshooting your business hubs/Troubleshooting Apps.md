If the automation task to invite a user to join the app fails, as part of the
process described in the article [Invite new app
members](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9045790-invite-new-app-members),

so, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your app with your admin account.

  2. Access your user permissions or collaboration space settings.

  3. Send an invitation to the corresponding user.

# Remove app members manually

  1. Log in to your app with your admin account.

  2. Access your user management or collaboration space settings.

  3. Remove the corresponding user.
