# Troubleshooting: Manually Removing Users from Business Center Accounts

**Description:** This article describes how to manually remove users from business center accounts to deprovision them successfully.

This article helps you fix the unsuccessful automatic removal of users in
business center accounts when deprovisioned from the corporate directory of
your Identity Provider (IDP) or removed from Cerby.

# **Cause of the Problem**

The unsuccessful automatic removal of users in business center accounts may be
due to one of the following scenarios:

  * When you remove users from the corporate directory synchronized between Cerby and your IDP, sometimes the automatic deprovisioning of users from your business center accounts fails. 

  * Currently, Cerby doesn't support automatic deprovisioning for all business centers. 

  * When you remove users in Cerby and don't have a corporate directory synchronized, the automatic deprovisioning doesn't occur.

If Cerby detects that some users are not automatically removed from business
center accounts, we notify the Account Owner and Workspace Admin via email. We
also flag the accounts and users that require action, as shown in **Figure
1**.
