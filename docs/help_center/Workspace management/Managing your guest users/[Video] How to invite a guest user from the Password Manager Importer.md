# [Video] How to invite a guest user from the Password Manager Importer

**Description:** This video shows how to invite a guest user to grant them access to the imported access permissions on items.

# **Key concepts**

  * After an import, external collaborators who are not part of your organization and donâ€™t have a Cerby account are identified as unmatched. To grant them the imported access permissions, you can send them an invite to join your workspace as guest users.

  * Guest users must open the invite and set up their account to join your Cerby workspace. For instructions, see the [How to join Cerby from a guest user invite](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8432613-video-how-to-join-cerby-from-a-guest-user-invite) video.
