# [Video] How to join Cerby from a guest user invite

**Description:** This video shows how external collaborators can join a Cerby workspace from a guest user invite.

# **Key concepts**

  * The Guest Users feature enables external collaborators to join a Cerby workspace without being added to a corporate directory managed by an identity provider, such as Okta or Azure AD. 

  * After receiving an invite via email, you must set up your Cerby account because authentication to the workspace is managed by Cerby. Additionally, for an optimized experience, Cerby recommends installing the client apps by completing the instructions in the following videos:

    * View secret content and download attachments.

    * View the items inside a collection, log in to accounts, and view secret content and download attachments.
