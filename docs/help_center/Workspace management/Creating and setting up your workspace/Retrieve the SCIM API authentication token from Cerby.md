Cerby uses the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
specification to configure automatic user and group provisioning between
identity providers (IdPs), such as Okta and Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), and
the multiple applications that companies use.

By enabling automatic provisioning, Cerby can manage the creation and
synchronization of user accounts and teams based on the user and group
assignments in your corporate IdP. To configure automatic provisioning and
authenticate SCIM provisioning requests, you need a SCIM API authentication
token generated by Cerby.

To retrieve the SCIM API authentication token, complete the following steps:

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** To view the SCIM API authentication
token, you must verify your identity. Therefore, you must have installed and
logged in to the Cerby mobile application to receive push notifications. {%
endhint %}

  2. Select the **Settings** option from the left navigation drawer. The **Workspace Configuration** page is displayed.
