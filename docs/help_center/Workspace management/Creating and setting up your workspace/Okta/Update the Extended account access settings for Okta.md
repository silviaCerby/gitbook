**Description:** This article describes how to update the settings of the Extended account access feature for Okta.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , and **Admins** * Supported using the Cerby web app {%
endhint %}

As a workspace **Admin** , **Super Admin** , or **Owner** , you can update the
settings of the **[Extended account
access](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9616265-explore-extended-account-
access)** feature for Okta. With this feature, you and all workspace members
can sync and extend the accounts they own to access them from their Okta
dashboard powered by Cerbyâ€™s automated login.

You may want to update these settings if the domain of your Okta instance
changes or the Okta API token expires. Cerby will display the **Update**
status in your workspace settings to indicate when the token is no longer
valid to perform syncs.
