# Configure automatic user and group provisioning with Entra ID via SCIM

**Description:** This article describes how to configure automatic user and group provisioning with your Entra ID tenant via SCIM.

With Cerby, you can configure automatic provisioning with Entra ID (formerly
Azure AD) using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
specification to manage the creation and synchronization of user accounts and
teams based on user and group assignments.

This article describes how to configure both the Cerby enterprise application
and Entra ID. When configured, Entra ID automatically provisions and
deprovisions users and groups to Cerby using the Entra ID provisioning
service. For more information on what this service does, how it works, and
frequently asked questions, read the article [What is app provisioning in
Microsoft Entra ID?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-
directory/app-provisioning/user-provisioning)

# **Supported features**

The following are the supported features of automatic user and group
provisioning with Entra ID:

  * **Push users:** Users assigned to the Cerby enterprise application in Entra ID are automatically able to access the Cerby clients (web app, mobile app, and browser extension); they are available to other users in Cerby for account sharing purposes.

  * **Push groups:** Users who are members of a group in Entra ID and assigned to the Cerby enterprise application are pushed to Cerby, and this grouping structure and its members are replicated in Cerby as [teams](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6624225-how-to-use-teams). 

  * Remove users in Cerby when they no longer require access.

  * Keep user attributes synced between Entra ID and Cerby.

  * **Disable or delete users:** Disabled or deleted users in Entra ID are automatically detected in Cerby, and their associated access grants in Cerby are removed. In some cases, additional follow-up actions, like password rotation, may occur in Cerby for privileged identities to which the deprovisioned user had access grants.

  * **Reactivate users:** Reactivated users in Entra ID will reappear as valid users in Cerby; however, account access grants must be reassigned in Cerby.

* * *

# **Requirements**

The following are the requirements to configure automatic user and group
provisioning with Entra ID:

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have the automated
group provisioning to apps feature included in your Entra ID plan level (P1 or
P2 license plan). {% endhint %}

  * An Entra ID tenant. For more information, read the article [Quickstart: Set up a tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)

# **Configure automatic provisioning with Entra ID**

To configure automatic user provisioning for Azure AD, you must complete the
following main steps:

  1. Plan your provisioning deployment

  2. Configure Cerby to support provisioning with Azure AD

  3. Add Cerby from the Entra ID application gallery

  4. Define the scope for provisioning

  5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Cerby

  6. Monitor your deployment

The following sections describe each main step.

## 1\. Plan your provisioning deployment

To plan your provisioning deployment with Entra ID, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Learn about how the provisioning service works. For more information, read the article [What is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/user-provisioning)

  2. Determine who will be in scope for provisioning. For more information, read the article [Scoping users or groups to be provisioned with scoping filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

  3. Determine what data to map between Entra ID and Cerby. For more information, read the article [Tutorial - Customize user provisioning attribute-mappings for SaaS applications in Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes).

The next step is 2\. Configure Cerby to support provisioning with Entra ID.

## 2\. Configure Cerby to support provisioning with Entra ID

Cerby has enabled the provisioning support for Entra ID by default. You must
follow the instructions from the article [Retrieve the SCIM API authentication
token from Cerby](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5683294-retrieve-the-
scim-api-authentication-token-from-cerby) to copy the SCIM API authentication
token.

The next step is 3\. Add Cerby from the Entra ID application gallery.

## 3\. Add Cerby from the Entra ID application gallery

You must add the Cerby enterprise application from the Entra ID application
gallery to manage provisioning to Cerby.

You can use the same application if you have previously set up Cerby for SSO.
However, we recommend you create a separate app when initially testing the
integration. For more information about adding an application from the
gallery, read the article [Quickstart: Add an enterprise
application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-
apps/add-application-portal).

The next step is 4\. Define the scope for provisioning.

## 4\. Define the scope for provisioning

The Entra ID provisioning service enables you to scope who will be provisioned
based on assignment to the Cerby enterprise application and or based on user
and group attributes.

  * **Scope based on assignment:** Follow the instructions from the article [Manage users and groups assignment to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) to assign users and groups to the application. 

  * **Scope based on user and group attributes:** Use a scoping filter as described in the article [Scoping users or groups to be provisioned with scoping filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

The following are some recommendations when defining the scope:

  * Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone:

    * When the scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can start by assigning one or two users or groups to the application.

    * When the scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an attribute-based scoping filter, according to the article [Scoping users or groups to be provisioned with scoping filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

  * If you need additional roles, you can update the application manifest. For more information, read the article [Add app roles to your application and receive them in the token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps).

The next step is 5\. Configure automatic user provisioning to Cerby.

cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes, as long as the Entra ID
provisioning service is running. Any group assigned to the Cerby application
in Entra ID is pushed automatically as a team in the corresponding Cerby
workspace. {% endhint %}

The next step is 6\. Monitor your deployment.

## 6\. Monitor your deployment

Monitor your deployment by using the following resources:

  * Use the provisioning logs to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully. For more information, read the article [What are the Microsoft Entra user provisioning logs?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs)

  * Verify the progress bar of the provisioning cycle synchronization to see how close it is to completion. For more information, read the article [Check the status of user provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user).

  * Verify the provisioning configuration health. If it is in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. For more information about quarantine states, read the article [Application provisioning in quarantine status](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status).

Now you are done.
