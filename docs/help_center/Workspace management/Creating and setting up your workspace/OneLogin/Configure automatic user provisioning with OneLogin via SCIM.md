# Configure automatic user provisioning with OneLogin via SCIM

**Description:** This article describes how to configure automatic user provisioning with your OneLogin integration via SCIM.

With Cerby, you can configure automatic provisioning with OneLogin using the
System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification to manage the
creation and synchronization of user accounts based on user assignments.

When you enable user provisioning in a OneLogin application, you can automate
multiple critical tasks for downstream user management, ensuring that
configuration is performed once and propagated throughout the Cerby platform.

This article describes how to enable OneLogin user provisioning for the Cerby
platform with SCIM.

# Supported features

The following are the supported features of automatic user provisioning with
OneLogin:

  * **Push users:** Users assigned to the Cerby application in OneLogin are automatically able to access the Cerby clients (web app, mobile app, and browser extension); they are available to other users in Cerby for account sharing purposes.

  * **Update user attributes:** The user attributes are automatically synchronized between Cerby and OneLogin.

  * **Suspend or delete users:** Suspended or deleted users in OneLogin are automatically detected in Cerby, and their associated access grants in Cerby are removed. In some cases, additional follow-up actions, like password rotation, may occur in Cerby for privileged identities to which the deprovisioned user had access grants.

# Requirements

The following are the requirements to enable OneLogin user provisioning with
SCIM:

  * A user account in Cerby with the workspace**Owner** role

  * The Cerby SAML-based app integration must be set up and deployed. You must have already deployed the integration as part of the article [Configure SSO between Cerby and OneLogin with SAML](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11814820-configure-sso-between-cerby-and-onelogin-with-saml).

  * Users from your directory already assigned to the Cerby application in OneLogin. You must have done the assignments as part of the article [Configure SSO between Cerby and OneLogin with SAML](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11814820-configure-sso-between-cerby-and-onelogin-with-saml).

  * A SCIM API authentication token. Follow the instructions in the article [Retrieve the SCIM API authentication token from Cerby](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5683294-retrieve-the-scim-api-authentication-token-from-cerby) to copy the token.  
​**NOTE:** If you need to regenerate the SCIM API authentication token, read
