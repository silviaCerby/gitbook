# Configure SSO between Cerby and OneLogin with SAML

**Description:** This article describes how to configure OneLogin to enable SSO with Cerby using a custom SAML application.

All Cerby users are able to configure a default Identity Provider (IdP) such
as OneLogin to leverage the single sign-on (SSO) authentication feature to
securely authenticate using a single set of credentials.

OneLogin supports a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) application to
integrate with other service providers easily. In this case, the integration
is with Amazon Cognito, and the SAML application is customized and points to a
specific Cerby workspace.

This article describes how to configure OneLogin as the primary IdP to enable
SSO with the Cerby platform using a SAML integration.

  * **Assigning apps to users in batches**. The most efficient way to assign apps to users is to batch-apply them in collections, using roles and mappings. For instructions, read the official OneLogin documentation [Roles](https://onelogin.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=cc2e602a973b2150c90c3b0e6253af3c&kb_category=566ffd6887332910695f0f66cebb3556).
