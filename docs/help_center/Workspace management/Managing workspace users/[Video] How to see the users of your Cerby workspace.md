# [Video] How to see the users of your Cerby workspace

**Description:** This video describes the user operations available to you when your workspace is configured with an external identity provider (e.g., Okta).

**Key Concepts:**

  * Only workspace-level admins can access the All Members view.

  * Available functionality in the All Members view depends on whether the Cerby workspace is linked to an upstream Corporate SSO system.

  * You are able to export all users and the accounts they have access to in the All Members view.
