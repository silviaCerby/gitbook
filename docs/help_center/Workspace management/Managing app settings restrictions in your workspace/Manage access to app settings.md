# Manage access to app settings

**Description:** This article explains how to manage user access to password and user settings, either blocking modifications or recommending Cerby for changes.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace **Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , and **Admins** * Only supported using the Cerby web app *
Workspace users must have the Cerby browser extension installed and logged in
{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Admin,** or **Super Admin** , you can control how
users modify password and user settings in specific apps. You can either
prevent them from making changes directly within the app or show a message
encouraging them to use Cerby while still allowing changes in the app. To
manage these settings, use the **App settings restrictions** feature.

As explained in the article [Explore App settings
restrictions](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10276184-explore-app-
settings-restrictions), you can apply the following restrictions to an appâ€™s
password or user settings:

  * Fully block

  * Monitor and prompt to Cerby

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** * Users must have the Cerby browser
extension installed and logged in for the feature to work properly. * Only
apps that belong to the Cerby catalog can be configured for setting
management. {% endhint %}
