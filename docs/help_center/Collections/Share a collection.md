# Share a collection

**Description:** This article describes how to share a collection with other workspace members and teams.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , **Admins** , **Users** , and **Guest Users** * Collection
**Owners** * Supported using the Cerby web app and mobile app. For the mobile
app instructions, read the article [Share a collection using the Cerby mobile
app](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9718995-share-a-collection-in-the-
cerby-mobile-app) {% endhint %}

As a collection **Owner** , you can share a collection with other workspace
members and teams and select the role to assign to them on the collection.
With this action, you extend access to all the items within the collection.

The following rules are applied to items, subcollections, members, and teams
when sharing a collection:

  * The role you select on the collection (**Owner** or **Collaborator**) is the same role that other members and teams will have on all the accounts, secrets, business hubs, and assets within the collection.

  * When your collection has subcollections, you are also sharing access to all nested subcollections and their items, inheriting the permission settings bottom-down.

  * When your collection already has business hub integrations and assets within, Cerby sends the corresponding emails for users to claim access to the integration. For more information, read the article [Manage access to business hubs and assets with collections](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11102692-manage-access-to-business-hubs-and-assets-with-collections).

  * Members with the **Login-only** and **Guest user** workspace roles can only be granted the **Collaborator** role on a collection.

To share a collection, you must complete the following steps using the Cerby
web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.

     * **Collaborator:** Members and teams can only log in to the accounts, view the secrets, and download the secret attachments.

**NOTE:** When you select a member with the **Login-only** role, they are

role for them.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** When you share a collection containing
business hubs and assets, Cerby sends emails for users to claim access to the
integration. After users claim access, Cerby triggers the automated jobs to
add these users to the external apps. For more information, read the article
