As a collection **Owner** , you can remove a user from a collection. With this
action, the user loses access at the collection level to all the items within
the collection. However, you can choose to grant them direct access to the
items.

To remove a user from a collection, you must complete the following steps
using the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **Settings** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1481536120/1eca4a12b24fde121832c095aa0a/AD_4nXcTuUI32R24x3fW2XHHCAqAf0iw1Oe8x8zklBLUvC8GU-I7ziw0SQ-NCNV6Zku1ndLJeFrYUWm4e60nAcrQ5DRPsax2h7cVAFkKFMv_aIdKojLr1vecWtl14NYRwA9ouyfyBU4oxQ?expires=1754514000&signature=ac17c07c7fceb433b504e45abf284cf3e367f967a76fedcb6e6ce1e6d519ce2e&req=dSQvF8x9m4BdWfMW3Hu4gflDvMsbYXmXvkXtoZUPK5I1MhbdcGxd8UWhb0I1%0AtQ%3D%3D%0A)) icon of the corresponding collection card. The collection details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.

  4. Activate the **Members** tab. The **Members** table is displayed with a list of users who have shared access to the collection.

  5. Click the **More options** (![](gitbook/imagesAD_4nXdkXB4bJQKagu9Z2asBmo16ViDtW2v8ItGFGuIWbdkPqK5fGuFMVdt-u_Sa2Du7QCcWLohoPlJZn2lV1k6ajt1zlFGU2s0q-zI7VngnoI_VpF6d0MFxZ8hNd5U6WhVAWgZGklmvED2YlLa4iz-p5aPZaDIl)) icon of the corresponding user. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  6. Select the **Remove from collection** option. A confirmation dialog box is displayed.

  7. Select what to do with user access to the accounts within the collection:

     * Select the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option to remove user access at the collection level. No direct access is granted to the accounts.

     * Unselect the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option to remove user access at the collection level but grant direct access to the accounts.  
â€‹**IMPORTANT:** In both scenarios, the user loses all access to the secrets
within the collection.

  8. Click the **Remove from Collection** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** When you remove a user from a collection

Now you are done.
