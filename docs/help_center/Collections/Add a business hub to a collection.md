As a collection and business hub **Owner** , you can add a business hub
integration to an existing collection. With this action, all workspace members
and teams who already have shared access to the collection are automatically
granted access to the business hub with the collection-level role.

To add a business hub to a collection, you must complete the following steps
using the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1481797165/477eb760df4d4276da1264802d2f/AD_4nXfq928eH6lW___VJhn6YkSzlvsBLWHdSZFfnaW1cPAOfvWfj__ce8kcI0ndYDqcrNKTdaYv47jSGGH_CLWU_vh8aELD-qdGfyXMWMp-gSlQ6XlSnmTdKYR4bVeTAZ4mXXEfUaodDURWwzLeDEp4Xg3i1QIk?expires=1745010000&signature=436f10008a7f01280fd686c0e52703cf8d2d2b7de16fdbd65298894e6581c9b4&req=dSQvF853moBZXPMW3Hu4gVzLdJHGxv0I5gB5fQiAN7%2Fn26KcgFKjreB%2FI1NB%0AKQ%3D%3D%0A)) icon of the corresponding business hub card.

  6. Click the **Next** button. The **Define App Role** page of the wizard is displayed.

     * When the app supports assets, the **Next** button is displayed:

       1. Click the **Next** button. The **Assign assets** page of the wizard is displayed with the different asset types organized in tabs, a list of available assets in the left section, and a **Role** section to the right. 

       2. Select the assets to share with other users and teams when you share the collection.

       3. Select the role to assign to users and teams on the assets.

       4. Activate the next asset type tab.

       5. Repeat steps b to d as necessary.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** For existing members and teams in the
collection, Cerby sends emails for them to claim access to the integration.

to the external apps. For more information, read the article [Manage access to
