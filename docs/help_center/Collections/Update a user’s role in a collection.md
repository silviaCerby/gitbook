As a collection **Owner** , you can update a user’s role in a collection. This
action also updates the user’s role for the items in the collection.

To update a user’s role in a collection, you must complete the following
steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **Settings** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1486900580/23f172c5a0af888468e80db35804/AD_4nXcTuUI32R24x3fW2XHHCAqAf0iw1Oe8x8zklBLUvC8GU-I7ziw0SQ-NCNV6Zku1ndLJeFrYUWm4e60nAcrQ5DRPsax2h7cVAFkKFMv_aIdKojLr1vecWtl14NYRwA9ouyfyBU4oxQ?expires=1745388000&signature=d3bf625733492a8eafb83a117db96297653545f8ac7055f627dd85fbbd0c8f84&req=dSQvEMB%2BnYRXWfMW3Hu4gRP0JEJQIMWCtVG1rotT7aUk6FM6NWg2R3iugVuu%0AGA%3D%3D%0A)) icon of the corresponding collection card. The collection details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.

  4. Activate the **Members** tab. The **Members** table is displayed with the list of users who have shared access to the collection, whether through direct access or through a team.  
​**NOTE:** You cannot update individual user roles if they have shared access
to the collection through a team. For instructions on how to update a team’s
role, read the article [Update a team’s role on a
collection](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11117085-update-a-team-s-role-
in-a-collection).

  5. Select the option from the **Cerby role** drop-down menu that corresponds to the new role for the user:

     * **Owner:** Users can share access to the collection, manage the item settings, and perform the actions of a **Collaborator**.

     * **Collaborator:** Users can only log in to accounts, view secrets, and download the secret attachments.

**NOTE:** Members with the **Login-only** and **Guest user** workspace roles
can only be granted the **Collaborator** role on a collection.

A success message box is displayed.

You are done.
