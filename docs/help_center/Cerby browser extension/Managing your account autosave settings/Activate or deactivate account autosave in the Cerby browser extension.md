browser extension {% endhint %}

As a workspace member with any role, except **Guest users** and **Login-Only**
, you can activate or deactivate the account autosave feature to control
whether the **Add a new account to Cerby** dialog box appears when logging in
or signing up for an account through its website.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** This feature may be restricted by
your workspace **Admin** for all workspace members by the following settings:
* **Prompted autosave:** When logging in or signing up for an account in
allowed domains configured in the workspace, a prompt dialog box asks whether
you want to save your credentials to Cerby. You can choose to save or skip the
account autosave. * **Enforced autosave:** When you log in or sign up for an
account in a specified domain, Cerby automatically saves the credentials. For
more information, read the article [Explore account
