# Generate secure passwords using the Cerby browser extension

**Description:** This article describes how to generate strong and secure passwords using the Password Generator feature in the Cerby browser extension.

With Cerby, you have a way to generate strong and secure passwords for your
accounts through the Password Generator.

This feature, available to any Cerby user via the Cerby browser extension,
enables you to generate passwords anytime and select the password strength
rules applicable to your application or service provider:

  * Length

  * Uppercase letters

  * Lowercase letters

  * Digits

  * Symbols

Based on your selection, the Password Generator also lets you know how weak or
strong the generated password is.

{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** A password is stronger the more rules
you select and the longer the password is. According to [Hive
Systems](https://www.hivesystems.io/password), it would take 226 years to hack
a 12-character password that comprises numbers, upper and lowercase letters,
and symbols. {% endhint %}

After generating a password, you can use it to create or set up your
application accounts. Then, you can add these accounts to Cerby to secure your
login.

Cerby uses the crypto library to generate random passwords that are unique
each time. Passwords are generated locally on the user devices based on the
strength rules set by the user, and Cerby implements entropy tests to make
sure they are highly random; therefore, difficult to guess or predict.
