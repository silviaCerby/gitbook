# Migrate your items from your enterprise password manager to Cerby

With Cerby, you can seamlessly transition from a traditional enterprise password manager (EPM) to our identity and access management platform with EPM capabilities.

Our **Password Manager Importer** feature ensures a smooth and secure migration from LastPass and 1Password to Cerby. Instead of manually saving each corporate account, you can effortlessly sync and import all your items into Cerby in one go.

Transitioning to Cerby offers significant advantages because we provide you with robust security features such as our Zero Knowledge architecture and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to confirm your identity when performing high-sensitive actions.

We also facilitate interoperability across your organization's ecosystem by integrating your workspace with your corporate Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta and Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), and enabling you to manage your users, accounts, secrets, collections, business hubs, assets, and teams in a centralized hub.

As part of your transition to Cerby, we offer you the **Import report** view in your Cerby dashboard. This view is displayed after you import the folders, vaults, and items from your password manager, as shown in **Figure 1**.

# What can you do with the Password Manager Importer?

With the Password Manager Importer, you can do the following:

  * Migrate from LastPass or 1Password to Cerby.
  * Select your LastPass folders and 1Password vaults to import them to Cerby as collections with all of the items inside them.
  * Import user access permissions for folders in LastPass and vaults in 1Password. For workspace members with an existing Cerby user account, these permissions automatically propagate to collections, accounts, and secrets.
  * Match LastPass and 1Password users automatically to their Cerby user account.
  * Keep a record of users who had access to your accounts through your EPM.

# Can’t wait, let’s start

If you are as excited as us about this new feature, here’s what you have to do next:

  1. Sync items from your EPM.
  2. Select the LastPass folders or 1Password vaults and import them to Cerby.
  3. Take action on your onboarded items.
  4. Start managing your items through Cerby
