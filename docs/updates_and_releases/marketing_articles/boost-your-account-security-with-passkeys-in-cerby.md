# Boost your account security with passkeys in Cerby

**Release date:** April, 2025

With the Cerby mobile app, you are always on top of security. We now support passkeys, a passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA) method for authenticating and accessing your accounts.

Passkeys offer a faster, safer, and more user-friendly alternative to passwords. With Cerby, you can enjoy all the benefits of this technology while ensuring that your data remains protected from threats.

## What are passkeys?

Passkeys are a passwordless MFA method that combines biometric authentication, such as Face ID, fingerprints, PINs, or security keys, with public-key cryptography. This system securely logs you into apps and websites without the need for a traditional password, offering a stronger, more secure alternative to password-based authentication.

## How do passkeys work?

Passkeys rely on two components: a public key, which is shared with websites or apps, and a private key, which stays securely on your device. When you log in, your device uses biometric authentication to unlock the private key, confirming your identity without exposing any credentials. The matching public key on the app or website then validates your access, allowing you to log in securely with no passwords needed.

This structure ensures that even if someone were to intercept the public key, they could never access your private key. To access accounts protected by passkeys, an attacker would need the passkey, access to your device, and the permissions to use it.

## Why use passkeys in Cerby?

By using passkeys in your Cerby mobile app, you are getting the following benefits:

  * **Passwordless authentication:** You don’t need to store your account password anymore. With passkeys, your authentication is done directly using your biometric information.
  * **Increased security:** Passkeys are phishing-resistant and immune to common password hacks. They are directly associated with the specific website or app domain and verified before releasing the private key store in your device. Furthermore, passkeys use cryptographic signatures instead of passwords, making them almost impossible to intercept or steal during transmission.
  * **Reduced password compliance policies:** Your company can reduce the policies around password policies, thus reducing administrative overhead and boosting operational productivity.
