**Who can use this feature?**

  * Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users**
  * Account**Owners** and**Collaborators**

{% endhint %}

As a user with any workspace role in Cerby, except the **Login-only** role, you can log in to your Cerby accounts from your Okta dashboard when your workspace has the **[Extended account access](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9616265-explore-extended-account-access)** feature enabled.

Account **Owners** must have already synced and extended their accounts for the corresponding chiclets to be displayed on the Okta dashboard. For instructions, read the article [Sync and extend an account to Okta](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9759106-sync-and-extend-an-account-to-okta).

Additionally, you must have the **Owner** or **Collaborator** role in such extended accounts to see the chiclets in your Okta dashboard for logging-in purposes.

**IMPORTANT:** You must have already installed the Cerby browser extension approved by your company.


{% endhint %}

To log in to your accounts from a chiclet in your Okta dashboard, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your Okta dashboard.
  2. Click the corresponding chiclet or application from your Okta dashboard. Okta redirects you to the Cerby platform and authenticates you automatically if you don’t have an active session in Cerby.

The Cerby browser extension autofills your credentials, including verification codes if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is on and managed by Cerby.

Now you are done.
