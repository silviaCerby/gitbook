# [Video] How to use the Activity view

## Key concepts

* All users, no matter their workspace-level role, can access the **Activity** view. To open it, select the corresponding option from the left navigation drawer using the Cerby web app.
* The information you can access is different depending on your workspace role:
    * **Workspace Users** can only view the activity of the items for which they have the **Owner** role.
    * **Workspace Admins** and **Super Admins** can see the user activity on all items and within the workspace. They can also download the activity report in a CSV file.
