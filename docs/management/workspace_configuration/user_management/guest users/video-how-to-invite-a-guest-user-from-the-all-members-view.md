# [Video] How to invite a guest user from the All Members view

## Key concepts

* Guest users have identities and authentication managed by Cerby. You can use this feature when external collaborators don’t belong to your domain or corporate directory.
* You can only assign the **Collaborator** role on the items you share with guest users. For instructions to share items with guest users, see the following videos:
