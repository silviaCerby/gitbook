# [Video] How to invite a guest user from the Password Manager Importer

## Key concepts

* After an import, external collaborators who are not part of your organization and don’t have a Cerby account are identified as unmatched. To grant them the imported access permissions, you can send them an invite to join your workspace as guest users.
* Guest users must open the invite and set up their account to join your Cerby workspace. For instructions, see the [How to join Cerby from a guest user invite](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-web-app/partners/guest-users/video-how-to-join-cerby-from-a-guest-user-invite) video.
* For more information about guest users, read the [How to invite a guest user to your workspace](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-guest-users) article.
