1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **All Members** option from the left menu. The **All Members** page is displayed.
3. Click the **Export** (<img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1431329883/cec44512d5374eec4fa24a2b5aa6/AD_4nXc8LNJbIUTkb4c-HqDY7lLQluKkLNbaWm4LfWjPstFuXAfW-44E34Xf2IeRMnM7lGLkBruEkofq7p9pmNSdw82m8Ek5zuzr6uv12pVo2eKlOt2WRaUofQc_ipwUiLtgGSipc6IB?expires=1742439900&signature=9d0aec224a37548c3de6d06fa517353b79b575010a7d48dec5ffa5960176b24b&req=dSQkF8p8lIlXWvMU3HP0gOBfTa%2FQcbttZgDl7dnitwh43DziRmE%3D%0A" alt="">) icon located at the top-right corner of the page. A success message box is displayed, and an email is sent when the export is ready.

4. Open the message Cerby sent to your email address.
5. Click the **Download Report** button. The CSV file is downloaded to your computer.

Now you are done.
