  2. Select the **All members** option from the left menu. The **All members** page is displayed with the **Members** tab activated.
  3. Select the option from the **Workspace role** drop-down list that corresponds to the new role of the workspace member:

     * **Super Admin:** Performs full workspace access management.
     * **Admin:** Invites and manages workspace users.
     * **User:** Adds and shares items with other workspace members.
     * **Login-Only:** Logs in to accounts and views items as a **Collaborator**.

## Workspace continuity: Reassign a workspace Owner

This section describes the process of reassigning the **Owner** of a Cerby workspace. This is a critical task, as this user holds the highest management permissions, and workspaces can only have one **Owner**.

If the current workspace **Owner** is scheduled for deprovisioning or their account is deactivated, this role must be securely transferred to another active user to ensure workspace continuity.

A workspace **SuperAdmin** or **Admin** , or a representative of your organization, you must contact the Cerby Support team for assistance via email at [support@cerby.com](mailto:support@cerby.com) or the help chat of the Cerby dashboard. Our team will verify the request and perform the workspace **Owner** reassignation.
