# Remove an account from a local partner

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Host Admins** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** of an existing [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners), you can remove an account from a local partner that you had shared previously. With this removal, all **Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** with shared access to the account lose access.

To remove an account from a local partner, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.
3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.
4. Click the **More options** (<img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1655799529/3842b76f0c091b267cdf3c62a6f6/AD_4nXcRXuZlqpWdtuRcbhBeIeUfl_5B0VnA7hHgYhRlZLlQllTLtgyvrcb55rwcAZYzy9YU_xRVvAKy46UM_gBLMP9ADO_qp8amFp-hX7ZeE_7BtkD5COF05wt_AyRzRORGxqs0smXgFtgeGkOBlr9xJ04mBYY?expires=1754441700&signature=81974377e3438f32d23a751e928e981dc6f4b7567ca79752a3b9a64bd6bd1d4f&req=dSYiE853lIRdUPMU3HP0gM9GC%2BlXE%2BxVuvV1s%2BFEkJxL519Nfn0%3D%0A" alt="">) icon on the right side of the corresponding account. A drop-down menu is displayed.
5. Select the **Remove** option. The **Remove account?** dialog box is displayed.
6. Click the **Remove account** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.
Cerby removes access to all **Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** with shared access to the account.

Now you are done.
