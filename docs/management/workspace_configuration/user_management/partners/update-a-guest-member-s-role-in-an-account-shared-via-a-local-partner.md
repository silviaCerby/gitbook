# Update a guest member’s role in an account shared via a local partner

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Host Admins** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** of an existing [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners), you can update a guest member’s role in an account you shared with a local partner. This update doesn’t affect the role of **Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** at the local partner level.

To update a guest member’s role in an account shared via a local partner, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
  2. Click the **More options** (<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1655793560/eb9d1039ed8e9be650114599a8e3/AD_4nXcRXuZlqpWdtuRcbhBeIeUfl_5B0VnA7hHgYhRlZLlQllTLtgyvrcb55rwcAZYzy9YU_xRVvAKy46UM_gBLMP9ADO_qp8amFp-hX7ZeE_7BtkD5COF05wt_AyRzRORGxqs0smXgFtgeGkOBlr9xJ04mBYY?expires=1764828000&signature=b3cb52855bafd162c98ea8e162a3a39958877315fc742761d8f227ff306b965b&req=dSYiE853noRZWfMW3Hu4gRr3GaU%2FeaBAQEqCkXJlDp%2FNkzxELjKVBDedYM70%0AfA%3D%3D%0A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>) icon that appears when hovering over the corresponding account card. A drop-down menu is displayed.
  3. Select the **View Members** option from the menu. The account details page is displayed with the **Users** tab activated.
  4. Activate the **Guest users** tab. A table of **Guest Users** with shared access to your account is displayed.
  5. Click the role of the corresponding **Guest User**. A side drawer is displayed with the current role of the user and a list of the different role assignments they have been granted on the account.
  6. Select the user’s new role from the **Role** drop-down:

     * **Account Manager:** Users can log in to the shared accounts and share access to these accounts with other **Guest Users**.
     * **Account Collaborator:** Users can only log in to the shared accounts.

  7. Click the **Apply** button. The side drawer closes, and a success message box is displayed.

Now you are done.
