# Remove a guest member from a local partner

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Host Admins** and**Guest Admins** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** or **Guest Admin** of a [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2), you can remove a **Guest Admin** or **Guest User** from an existing local partner, which also causes them to be removed from the Cerby workspace.

The following rules apply when removing a guest member:

* **Host Admins** can remove **Guest Users** and **Guest Admins**.
* **Guest Admins** can only remove **Guest Users** , and they cannot remove themselves.
* Accounts shared through the local partner are not affected.

To remove a guest member from a local partner, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.
3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.
4. Activate the **Users** tab. The partner’s members and their roles are displayed.

**NOTE:** **Guest Admins** are the only ones who can propagate access to the accounts that **Host Admins** share with the local partner. So, make sure to designate a **Guest Admin** if you want to share more accounts with **Guest Users** through a local partner.

Now you are done.
