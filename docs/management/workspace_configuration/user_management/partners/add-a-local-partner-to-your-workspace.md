{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a workspace**Owner** , **Super Admin** , or **Admin** , you can add a [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners) to your Cerby workspace to streamline collaboration with external parties, such as contractors, agencies, vendors, and clients.

A local partner is a subgroup or organization of guest users within your workspace to which you can grant access to the necessary accounts for collaboration. Additionally, you can delegate the work of inviting guest users to an external collaborator by assigning them the **Guest Admin** role.
