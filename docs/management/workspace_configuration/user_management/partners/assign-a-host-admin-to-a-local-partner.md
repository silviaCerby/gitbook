As a **Host Admin** of a [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners), you can assign one or multiple **Host Admins** to your existing local partner. **Host Admins** can manage the local partner and its guest users, and share accounts with the local partner.

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.
3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.
