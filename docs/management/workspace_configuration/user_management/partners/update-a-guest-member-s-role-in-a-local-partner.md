# Update a guest member's role in a local partner

**Who can use this feature?**

* **Host Admins** and**Guest Admins** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app

---

As a **Host Admin** or **Guest Admin** of a [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners), you can update a guest member’s role to grant them the permissions they need to streamline collaboration.

The following rules apply when updating roles:

* **Host Admins** and **Guest Admins** can update the role of **Guest Users** to **Guest Admins** and vice versa.
* **Guest Admins** can downgrade themselves to **Guest Users**.

To update a guest member’s role, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
  2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.
  3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.
  4. Activate the **Users** tab. The partners’ members and their roles are displayed.
  5. Click the role of the user you want to update. A drop-down menu is displayed with the following options:

     * **Guest User:** They can only view and receive access to accounts that a **Host Admin** shares with the local partner.
     * **Guest Admin:** They can invite and share items with other **Guest Users** to whom they were granted the account **Manager** role.

  6. Select the new role. A success message box is displayed.

Now you are done.
