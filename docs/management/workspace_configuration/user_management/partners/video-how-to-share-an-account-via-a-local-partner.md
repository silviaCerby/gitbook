# [Video] How to share an account via a local partner

## Key concepts

* Only **Host Admins** of an existing [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners) can share the accounts they own with a local partner for collaboration purposes.
* By default, the only users on the local partner’s side who receive shared access to the accounts are the **Guest Admins** , who can be assigned any of the following two roles:
  * **Collaborator: Guest Admins** can only log in to the accounts through Cerby.
  * **Manager: Guest Admins** can log in to the accounts through Cerby and share access to them with other **Guest Users** ; they cannot manage the account details.

The process of sharing an account via a local partner comprises two main steps performed by different users:

## 2\. Share an account with a guest user

After an account is shared with a local partner and the **Manager** role is assigned, the designated **Guest Admin** of a local partner shares the account with other **Guest Users**.
