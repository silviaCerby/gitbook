# Remove a local partner from your workspace

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Host Admins** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** of an existing [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners), you can remove it from your workspace when you no longer need to share accounts with external collaborators. The following occurs when you remove a local partner:

* All**Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** of the local partner are removed from the workspace, leaving their Cerby user accounts deactivated. Therefore, they also lose access to the accounts shared via the local partner.
* All **Host Admins** lose their local partner role; their account roles are not affected.

To remove a local partner from your workspace, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Partners** option from the left menu. The **Partners** page is displayed.
3. Select the corresponding local partner from the **Your partners** list. The partner details section is displayed.
4. Click the **More options** (<img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1655801881/ed7b26c0c2e8944cf4eb12c03e61/AD_4nXcRXuZlqpWdtuRcbhBeIeUfl_5B0VnA7hHgYhRlZLlQllTLtgyvrcb55rwcAZYzy9YU_xRVvAKy46UM_gBLMP9ADO_qp8amFp-hX7ZeE_7BtkD5COF05wt_AyRzRORGxqs0smXgFtgeGkOBlr9xJ04mBYY?expires=1754441700&signature=7a69425d546fb268e548b0989433fdc6cb120b55885e5d6c8035d3d17558f2fd&req=dSYiE8F%2BnIlXWPMU3HP0gG0aY2OZhIFQjeQnoUQ4V5iWYnuQNp8%3D%0A" alt="">) icon located at the top right of the partner details section. A drop-down menu is displayed.
5. Select the **Remove partner** option. The **Remove partner?** dialog box appears.
6. Click the **Remove partner** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.
Cerby removes all **Guest Admins** and **Guest Users** from the workspace.

Now you are done.
