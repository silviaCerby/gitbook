# [Video] How to invite a guest user to a local partner

## Key concepts

* **Host Admins** and **Guest Admins** of an existing [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners) can start inviting guest users to a workspace for collaboration purposes.
* After sending the invite via email, guest users must open the invite and set up their account to join the Cerby workspace. For instructions, see the video [How to join a local partner as a guest user](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-web-app/partners/local-partners/video-how-to-join-a-local-partner-as-a-guest-user).
* A **Host Admin** can share accounts and secrets with a local partner and assign the **Collaborator** or **Manager** role to the **Guest Admin**. With the **Manager** role, **Guest Admins** can share access to the items with other guest users. For instructions on sharing items with guest users, see the video [How to share an account via a local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/workspace-configuration/user-management/partners/video-how-to-share-an-account-via-a-local-partner).
* After joining a workspace, the access of all **Guest Users** is managed by **Guest Admins**. For more information, read the article [Manage a local partner’s guest members](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9039128-manage-a-local-partner-s-guest-members).
