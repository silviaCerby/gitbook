# Manage access to app settings

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app
* Workspace users must have the Cerby browser extension installed and logged in


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Admin,** or **Super Admin** , you can control how users modify password and user settings in specific apps. You can either prevent them from making changes directly within the app or show a message encouraging them to use Cerby while still allowing changes in the app. To manage these settings, use the **App settings restrictions** feature.

As explained in the article [Explore App settings restrictions](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-app-settings-restrictions), you can apply the following restrictions to an app’s password or user settings:

* Fully block
* Monitor and prompt to Cerby

{% hint style="danger" %}


**IMPORTANT:**

* Users must have the Cerby browser extension installed and logged in for the feature to work properly.
* Only apps that belong to the Cerby catalog can be configured for setting management.


{% endhint %}
