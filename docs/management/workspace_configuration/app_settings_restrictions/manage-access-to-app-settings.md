# Manage access to app settings

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app
* Workspace users must have the Cerby browser extension installed and logged in


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Super Admin** , or **Admin** , you can control how users change password and member settings and delete accounts in specific apps. You can either prevent them from making changes directly within the app or show a message encouraging them to use Cerby while still allowing changes in the app. To manage these settings, use the **App setting restrictions** feature.

As explained in the article [Explore App setting restrictions](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10276184-explore-app-settings-restrictions), you can apply the following restrictions to an app’s password, members, and account deletion:

* Fully block
* Prompt users to Cerby

{% hint style="danger" %}


**IMPORTANT:** Take the following into consideration about this feature:

* Users must have the Cerby browser extension installed and logged in for the feature to work properly.
* Only apps that belong to the Cerby catalog can be configured.
* Restrictions are not immediate due to a 5-minute cache; therefore, a site refresh might be needed.
* If a user is logged out from the browser extension, they remain with the last configuration they had before logging out.


{% endhint %}
