# [Video] How to import items to Cerby via the Password Manager Importer

# Key concepts

  * Currently, Cerby supports imports from LastPass.
  * All of the items inside a shared folder in the password manager are transferred as follows to Cerby:
    * Folders become collections with the same items inside.
    * Passwords become accounts inside a collection.
    * Secure notes and their attachments become secrets inside a collection.
    * Groups become teams.
