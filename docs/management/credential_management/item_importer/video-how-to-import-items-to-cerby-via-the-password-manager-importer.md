# [Video] How to import items to Cerby via the Password Manager Importer

## Key concepts

* Currently, Cerby supports imports from LastPass.
* All of the items inside a shared folder in the password manager are transferred as follows to Cerby:
  * Folders become collections with the same items inside.
  * Passwords become accounts inside a collection.
  * Secure notes and their attachments become secrets inside a collection.
  * Groups become teams.
* For more information on the import rules and frequently asked questions, read the [How to use the Password Manager Importer](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/credential-management/item-importer/migrate-from-lastpass-to-cerby) and [Password Manager Importer troubleshooting and FAQs](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/troubleshooting/password-manager-importer-troubleshooting-and-faqs) articles.
