# Add an asset to a collection

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users**
* Collection, business hub, and asset **Owners**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a collection, business hub integration, and asset **Owner** , you can add an asset to an existing collection. With this action, all workspace members and teams who already have shared access to the collection are automatically granted access to the asset with the collection-level role.

The process of adding an asset to a collection is different, depending on whether a business hub already exists in the collection or not:

* [Add an individual asset to a collection](add-an-asset-to-a-collection.md#add-an-individual-asset-to-a-collection)
* [Add an asset for an existing business hub in a collection](add-an-asset-to-a-collection.md#add-an-asset-for-an-existing-business-hub-in-a-collection)

The following sections describe each process.

**NOTE:** For existing members and teams in the collection, Cerby sends them emails to claim access to the business hub and assets. After they claim access, Cerby adds these users to the external apps and the assets. If members and teams already have direct access to the business hub, they must only claim access to the assets.
