  2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** When you remove a team from a collection
containing business hubs and assets, Cerby triggers the automation jobs to
remove all team members from the external apps. For more information, read the
article [Manage access to business hubs and assets with
