2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.
3.  Click the **Settings** (

**NOTE:** When you remove a team from a collection containing business hubs and assets, Cerby also removes all team members from the external apps. For more information, read the article [Manage access to business hubs and assets with collections](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/identity-lifecycle/business-hubs/manage-integrations/manage-access-to-business-hubs-and-assets-with-collections).

Now you are done.
