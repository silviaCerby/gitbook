As a collection and business hub **Owner** , you can remove a business hub
from a collection. When you take this action, you must choose whether to
remove or keep the access that users and teams have to the business hub
through the collection.

To remove a business hub from a collection, you must complete the following
steps using the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **Settings** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1752170674/6f9f2e71f2cb190706a437fe11bc/36936d2f-41d9-4370-9fb9-40a7370336bc?expires=1759215750&signature=65f19f04c4b8ec62ff6b5ba6651dc8aa5218a91243b05a6720c77fbc049bf4e5&req=dSciFMh5nYdYXfMU3HP0gAPmosY4xkNyTgsxBdxGOttpRqF67kU%3D%0A)) icon of the corresponding collection card. The collection details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.

  4. Activate the **Business hubs** tab.

A drop-down menu is displayed.

  6. Select the **Remove from Collection** option from the drop-down menu. A confirmation dialog box is displayed.

  7. Choose what to do with access granted to the business hub through the collection:

     * Remove access granted through the collection:

       1. Select the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option.

     * Keep access granted through the collection as individual access:

       1. Unselect the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option.

  8. Click the **Remove from Collection** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** If in step 7 you selected to remove access
granted through the collection, Cerby initiates in the background automation
jobs to remove users from the external app only when users and teams don’t
have other access grants to the business hub. {% endhint %}

Now you are done.
