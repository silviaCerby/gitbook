# Add an asset to a collection

**Description:** This article describes how to add an asset to an existing collection.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users** * Collection, business hub, and
asset **Owners** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a collection, business hub integration, and asset **Owner** , you can add
an asset to an existing collection. With this action, all workspace members
and teams who already have shared access to the collection are automatically
granted access to the asset with the collection-level role.

The process of adding an asset to a collection is different, depending on
whether a business hub already exists in the collection or not:

  * Add an individual asset to a collection

  * Add an asset for an existing business hub in a collection

The following sections describe each process.

# Add an individual asset to a collection

To add an individual asset to a collection, you must complete the following
steps using the Cerby web app:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **More options** () icon of the corresponding business hub card. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  4. Select the **Settings** option from the menu. The business hub details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.

  5. Activate the **Assets** tab.

  6. Click the **More options** () icon of the corresponding asset card. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  7. Select the **Add to Collection** option from the menu. The **Add to collection** dialog box is displayed with a list of collections and subcollections.

  8. Select the corresponding collection from the list or look it up using the search bar.

  9. Click the **Next** button. The **Define App Role** of the wizard is displayed with a list of roles.

  10. Select the role to assign to users and teams on the external app assets.

  11. Click the **Add to collection** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %} **NOTE:** For existing members and teams in the
collection, Cerby sends them emails to claim access to the business hub and
assets. After they claim access, Cerby triggers the automation jobs to add
these users to the external apps and the assets because that’s the typical
hierarchical structure. If members and teams already have direct access to the
business hub, they must only claim access to the assets. For more information,
read the article [Manage access to business hubs and assets with
collections](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11102692-manage-access-to-
business-hubs-and-assets-with-collections). {% endhint %}

Now you are done.

  2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.

  5. Click the **Add assets** button located at the top right of the **Assets in the collection** section. A wizard is displayed with the **Select business hubs** page.
