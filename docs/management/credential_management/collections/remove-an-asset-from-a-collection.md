As a collection **Owner** , you can remove an asset from a collection. When you take this action, you must choose whether to remove or keep the access that users and teams have to the asset through the collection.

To remove an asset from a collection, you must complete the following steps using the Cerby web app:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.
3.

7. Choose what to do with access granted to the business hub through the collection:

   * Remove access granted through the collection:

     1. Select the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option.

   * Keep access granted through the collection as individual access:

     1. Unselect the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option.
