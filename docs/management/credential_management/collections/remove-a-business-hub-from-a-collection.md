As a collection and business hub **Owner** , you can remove a business hub from a collection. When you take this action, you must choose whether to remove or keep the access that users and teams have to the business hub through the collection.

To remove a business hub from a collection, you must complete the following steps using the Cerby web app:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Collections** option from the left menu. The **Collections** page is displayed.
3.  Click the **Settings** (

    ) icon of the corresponding collection card. The collection details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.
4. Activate the **Business hubs** tab.
5.  Click the **More options**(

    ) icon of the corresponding business hub. A drop-down menu is displayed.
6. Select the **Remove from Collection** option from the drop-down menu. A confirmation dialog box is displayed.
7. Choose what to do with access granted to the business hub through the collection:
   * Remove access granted through the collection:
     1. Select the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option.
   * Keep access granted through the collection as individual access:
     1. Unselect the **Remove account permissions shared through the collection** option.
8. Click the **Remove from Collection** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** If in step 7 you selected to remove access granted through the collection, Cerby removes users from the external app only when users and teams don’t have other access grants to the business hub.
{% endhint %}

Now you are done.
