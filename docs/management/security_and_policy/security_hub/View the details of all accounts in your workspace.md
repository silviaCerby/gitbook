# View the details of all accounts in your workspace

**Description:** This article describes how to view the details of all accounts in your workspace.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Owners** ,
**Super Admins** , and **Admins** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {%
endhint %}

In Cerby, the **Total accounts** page provides a unified view of all accounts
stored in your workspace. It helps workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** ,
and **Admins** quickly understand who owns which accounts, whether multi-
factor authentication (MFA) is turned on, and when each account was last used.

This visibility is essential for managing access, maintaining security, and
identifying unused or improperly configured accounts.

You can use the **Total accounts** page whenever you need to:

  * Perform a security review

  * Reassign account ownership

  * Audit MFA compliance

  * Prepare for offboarding or onboarding

  * Detect orphaned or risky accounts

  * Understand your organization’s actual app-usage footprint

**Figure 1** shows an example of the **Total accounts** page.

**Figure 1.** The **Total accounts** page

The following is the information presented in each column of the page:

  * **Account:** Lists the application and the account name. The application’s icon and name appear first, followed by the specific account label.

  * **Username:** Displays the username or login identifier used for that account, considering that multiple accounts might exist for the same application.

  * **MFA:** Shows whether MFA is turned on for the account. The **MFA** chip in this column indicates that Cerby successfully detected MFA.

  * **Owners:** Lists the account **Owners** through round user badges with their initials or pictures. An account may have one or several owners.

  * **Last used:** Indicates when the account was last accessed and by whom.
