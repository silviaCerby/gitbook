# Include an account in a password policy

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

  * Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
  * Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Admin** , you can include an account in an existing [password policy](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11465716-explore-password-policies) so that automated password rotations are executed for it.

**IMPORTANT:** You can only include accounts that were already excluded from a password policy. They are identified with the **Excluded** status in the table of policies.
