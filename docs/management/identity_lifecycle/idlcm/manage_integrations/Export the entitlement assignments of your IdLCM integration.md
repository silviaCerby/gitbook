integration as a CSV file.

When you export your entitlement assignments, you receive a detailed snapshot
of your users’ entitlements, including workspace and integration context,
assignment information, audit history, and user mapping. This export provides
you with an offline record to verify user access, confirm assignment accuracy
against the upstream identity platform, and keep an auditable history of
changes.
