{% hint style="info" %}

  * Workspace **Owners** , **Super** **Admins** , and **Admins**
  * Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Super** **Admin** , or **Admin** , you can view the entitlements in your IdLCM integration and the users assigned to them.

Entitlements are specific permissions granted to a user or role to perform actions on a resource within an external app. Entitlements dictate what a user can do, for example, reading a file, modifying a database record, or viewing customer data.

The following are the actions you can perform when working with entitlements:

  * View the entitlements available in your integration
  * View the users assigned to an entitlement

The following sections describe each action.
