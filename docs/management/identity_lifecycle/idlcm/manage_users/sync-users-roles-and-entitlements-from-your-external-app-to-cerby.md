# Sync users, roles, and entitlements from your external app to Cerby

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

  * Workspace**Owners, Super Admins,** and**Admins**
  * Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a workspace**Owner, Super Admin,** or**Admin** , you can trigger a sync to identify and import user, role, and entitlement changes from your external app to Cerby.

Cerby recommends triggering these syncs after manually updating users' assignments in the Cerby-integrated app to ensure the most current data is imported. User, role, and entitlement changes are automatically applied to Cerby during a sync.

To sync the user, role, and entitlements from your external app to Cerby, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
  2. Select the **Integrations** option from the left menu. The **Integrations** page is displayed.
  3. Click the **More options** (<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1586557793/6ae48ff3eebcad0460e7e856abf6/AD_4nXeeGJZmzwaS-SRUr4CcvXA1PA3rISj09RcmqDq85HoPba8eNIqf_R3tEAQLnllWdWILc1Bqh27pzMZyY8U-YoVbHP4ySRBvsA4AaWgWOVhb9ZQEVfVl1HbwHEUl3rKefAJYLA_HjA?expires=1759266000&signature=0e63b58c8833e26d44171b289486cbe17b917986b181dda28814f27a7d63c03d&req=dSUvEMx7moZWWvMW3Hu4gWc5s%2FCGeb8lQBNXZFnkq07Iz8hfLP9YuBRCeuOA%0ADA%3D%3D%0A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>) icon of the corresponding integration. A drop-down menu is displayed.
  4. Select the **Settings** option from the menu. The integrations details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.
  5. Click the **Sync** button located at the top right of the page.
​**NOTE:** The check and import may take a few minutes, depending on the number of users. When the process is complete, a success message box is displayed.

Now you are done.
