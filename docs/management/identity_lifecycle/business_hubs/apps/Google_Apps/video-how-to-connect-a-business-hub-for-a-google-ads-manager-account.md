# [Video] How to connect a business hub for a Google Ads Manager account

## Key concepts

* With a Google Ads Manager business hub in Cerby, you can import the following user data to centrally and securely manage access to your Google Ads Manager account from Cerby:
  * Members or users
  * Native partners
  * Roles and permissions
  * Assets, campaigns, and accounts

  **IMPORTANT:** For a successful onboarding, make sure you meet the following prerequisites before getting started:

* An active user account with an **Admin** role in the Google Ads Manager account.
* An MCC ID. You can find the ID in the business information or settings by completing the following steps:
  1. Log in to Google Ads Manager.
  2. The ID is the 10-digit number displayed at the top-right corner of the page next to your profile picture.
  3. Copy the ID and remove the dashes between the numbers to get only the numerical value of your ID. For example, if the MCC ID is **`733-123-4567`,** the number you need for the integration is **`7331234567`**.
