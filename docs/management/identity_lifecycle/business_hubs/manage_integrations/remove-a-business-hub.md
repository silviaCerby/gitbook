# Remove a business hub

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Business hubs **Owners**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can remove a business hub from Cerby when needed. When you remove a business hub, all accounts added to Cerby and connected to the business hub remain in your workspace, and no changes are made to users in the external app.

**NOTE:** If you no longer want to manage these accounts in Cerby, you must require users to remove their accounts from the platform. Also, you can choose to keep multi-factor authentication (MFA) on by configuring it with a different authenticator app or turning off MFA.
