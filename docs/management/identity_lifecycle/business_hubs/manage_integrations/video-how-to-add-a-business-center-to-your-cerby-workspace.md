# [Video] How to add a Business Center to your Cerby workspace

**Key Concepts:**

* For Facebook / Meta Business Center, Cerby will create a dedicated application for you. You must request it via Cerby support before proceeding with the import.
* Once you have the application id on hand, you will likely also need an API token. Business center specific details for obtaining the API token can be found below:
