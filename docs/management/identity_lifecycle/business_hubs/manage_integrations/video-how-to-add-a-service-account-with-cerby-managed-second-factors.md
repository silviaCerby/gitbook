# [Video] How to add a service account with Cerby-managed second factors

# Key concepts

  * Service accounts are accounts not intended for human use that enable Cerby to perform server-side automation tasks on your behalf. Usually, you assign admin access to these accounts in your apps to perform user and access management tasks.
  * Cerby recommends generating and setting up second factors (email addresses and phone numbers) and turning on two-factor authentication managed by Cerby to secure your accounts, streamline your logging-in processes, ensure account access continuity, and comply with corporate security policies.
  * In the Cerby platform, we use service accounts as follows:
    * **Automation accounts** that you connect to an [App](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9046120-connect-an-app) integration
    * **Monitor accounts** that enable our app integrations to retrieve user data from the [native partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_e7fa9c355c) of a paid social app, such as TikTok for Business or Pinterest Business
  * When working with external collaborators who must create and set up service accounts on your behalf, you can share the account with them via a [public link](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8308908-how-to-share-items-with-external-users-via-a-link) so that they can copy the values they need to sign up.
