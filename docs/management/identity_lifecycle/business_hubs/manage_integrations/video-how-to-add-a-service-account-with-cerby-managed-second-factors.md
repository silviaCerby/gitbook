# [Video] How to add a service account with Cerby-managed second factors

## Key concepts

* Service accounts are accounts not intended for human use that enable Cerby to perform server-side automation tasks on your behalf. Usually, you assign admin access to these accounts in your apps to perform user and access management tasks.
* Cerby recommends generating and setting up second factors (email addresses and phone numbers) and turning on two-factor authentication managed by Cerby to secure your accounts, streamline your logging-in processes, ensure account access continuity, and comply with corporate security policies.
* In the Cerby platform, we use service accounts as follows:
  * **Automation accounts** that you connect to an [App](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/identity-lifecycle/business-hubs/manage-integrations/connect-a-business-hub-for-your-app) integration
  * **Monitor accounts** that enable our app integrations to retrieve user data from the [native partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners) of a paid social app, such as TikTok for Business or Pinterest Business
* When working with external collaborators who must create and set up service accounts on your behalf, you can share the account with them via a [public link](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-web-app/accounts/share-items-with-external-users-via-a-link) so that they can copy the values they need to sign up.
