# [Video] How to connect an App

## Key concepts

* With an App integration, you can import to Cerby and sync the following user data from your seat-based and paid social apps:
    * Members or users
    * Native partners
    * Roles and permissions
    * Assets, such as ad accounts, pages, and pixels
* Cerby Apps are connected to your collaboration spaces (workspaces, dashboards, or teams) via an integration based on application programming interfaces (APIs) and agents built by Cerby.
* The following are the requirements to connect your app to Cerby:
    * An automation account, meaning an active user account with a native admin role in the seat-based or paid social app\
      **NOTE:** Cerby recommends having a dedicated account for this purpose, not intended for human use

    * A business or organization ID
​**NOTE:** Not all the **Apps** require a business or organization ID; Cerby displays this input field when applicable to your app. For instructions on how to find the ID, read the [Requirements](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-business-hubs) section of the article [How to use Tenants](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-business-hubs).
