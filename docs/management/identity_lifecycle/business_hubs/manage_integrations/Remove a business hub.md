**Owners** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can remove a business hub from Cerby when
needed. When you remove it, all accounts added to Cerby and connected to the
business hub remain in your workspace. Additionally, no automation jobs are
triggered to remove users from the external app.

**NOTE:** If you no longer want to manage these accounts in Cerby, you must
require users to remove their accounts from the platform. Also, you can choose
to keep multi-factor authentication (MFA) on by configuring it with a
different authenticator app or turning off MFA.
