# Sync your business hub with your external app

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

  * Business hub **Owners**
  * Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can initiate a sync to ensure that the information shown in Cerby is up to date with the information available in your seat-based and paid social apps.

Cerby keeps your business hubs up to date automatically, but you can also run syncs at any time. Whenever you perform manual updates in the external app, Cerby recommends running a sync to ensure the latest information is reflected in your business hub.

To sync your business hub with your external app, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.
  3. Click the **More options** (<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1723576197/6fcb0b167d21af5b2cc374320a87/10b3dd88-e196-43c4-86f3-57ebfdb164a6?expires=1764504000&signature=d4d87c5cb72251ac4867992190573a1e10647344fb9d3ab1c8bd4feb1c718b14&req=dSclFcx5m4BWXvMW3Hu4gZFxFppurDZAiaBWej0kdzb8UG4Li9WaIYVQ3q5r%0Aag%3D%3D%0A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>) icon of the corresponding business hub card.
