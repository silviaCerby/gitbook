# Turn on MFA for user accounts

When you turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for a user account via a
business hub, Cerby initiates a background automation job to execute this
security task.

With MFA on and managed by Cerby, verification codes are automatically filled
when users log in to their app using the Cerby web app or Cerby browser
extension. When users log in with a mobile phone, they can use the autofill
feature of the Cerby mobile app for iOS and Android.

To turn on MFA automatically for an app user account, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.
