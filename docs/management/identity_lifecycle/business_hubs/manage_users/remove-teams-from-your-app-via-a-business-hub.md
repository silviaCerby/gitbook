As a business hub **Owner** , you can remove the teams from your external seat-based and paid social apps through Cerby.

This process involves removing team members' access to the business hub integration in Cerby.

To remove a team from your external app via a business hub, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Select the **Business Hub** option from the left menu. The **Business Hub** page is displayed.
3. Click the **More options** (<img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1459550726/2c4b89ea0ff3d09b591dece0966e/AD_4nXeDv39vYt8AfjUeYhTMbZcDCBLqnr7UHGne7bwj7FBYMTqoNRR1dgF5XhV2nWQ9eMywbbrsfIfd3nxYLQj6WFJW8tPO1TbCSjCR_7UzG1ucELYtILCo7EKV34JVAZlSa-LyP-it0w?expires=1764450000&signature=b273528b8b733e117ace0d67b53ee75c3bd1aae3d3c6b4f53f2c3ce1c503294c&req=dSQiH8x7nYZdX%2FMW3Hu4gfU8Es%2FTaqZoJ8fN2JQcgIOXRYiVlb5zZNnnWZVV%0AIA%3D%3D%0A" alt="">) icon of the corresponding business hub card. A drop-down menu is displayed.

5. Activate the **Teams** tab.
6. Click the **More options** (<img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1459550726/2c4b89ea0ff3d09b591dece0966e/AD_4nXeDv39vYt8AfjUeYhTMbZcDCBLqnr7UHGne7bwj7FBYMTqoNRR1dgF5XhV2nWQ9eMywbbrsfIfd3nxYLQj6WFJW8tPO1TbCSjCR_7UzG1ucELYtILCo7EKV34JVAZlSa-LyP-it0w?expires=1764450000&signature=b273528b8b733e117ace0d67b53ee75c3bd1aae3d3c6b4f53f2c3ce1c503294c&req=dSQiH8x7nYZdX%2FMW3Hu4gfU8Es%2FTaqZoJ8fN2JQcgIOXRYiVlb5zZNnnWZVV%0AIA%3D%3D%0A" alt="">) icon of the corresponding team. A drop-down menu is displayed.
7. Select the**Remove team** option. The**Remove team access?** dialog box is displayed.
8. Click the **Yes, remove team access** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed. Users with access to the business hub integration only through this team are removed from the business hub and the external app.

Now you are done.

## Important considerations

While the instructions above provide a general guide for removing teams, outcomes can vary depending on how access was granted to the business hub integration. The following are important considerations:

* Users who keep shared access to the integration, whether individually or through another team, will not be removed from the external app. Cerby ensures that their role in the external app is updated to reflect their remaining access.
* To fully remove users’ access, make sure you review and remove all existing user and team access grants to the business hub integration.
* Removals from the external app or the business hub _don’t_ affect user access to their Cerby workspace.
