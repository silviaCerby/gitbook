**Owners** * Only supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can trigger a sync to identify changes in
users, roles, and assets within your seat-based and paid social apps and
import those changes to Cerby.

Cerby triggers daily syncs for all business hubs via automation jobs, but you
can also trigger these checks manually from your dashboard. Whenever you
manually update users and roles in the external app, Cerby recommends
triggering a sync to import the latest information to your business hub.

To sync your business hub with your external app, you must complete the
following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.

  3. Click the **More options** (![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1723576197/6fcb0b167d21af5b2cc374320a87/10b3dd88-e196-43c4-86f3-57ebfdb164a6?expires=1757712750&signature=c3bfe16080a2bb51642dee7276501dc806cb0b77b3c04292a4beaff181665475&req=dSclFcx5m4BWXvMU3HP0gLQFnzGPMjNKj4VjYOvPytjpPy0Nj8k%3D%0A)) icon of the corresponding business hub card. A drop-down menu is displayed.

  4. Select the **Settings** option from the menu. The business hub details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.

  5. Click the**Sync** button located at the top-right section of the page. A message box is displayed with information about the process.  
**NOTE:** The sync process may take a few minutes depending on the number of
users and assets. You can review the progress of the automated task through
the **Automation** **Log** page.

  6. Activate the **Users** tab. The recently synced app users are displayed in the following tabs of the **User Overview** section:

     * **Onboarded users:** This tab displays the users matched to their Cerby account. 

     * **Unmatched users:** This tab displays the users who were not automatically matched because they use an email address that couldn’t be identified or are not in the corporate directory. 

     * **Guest users:** This tab displays the users matched to an existing Cerby user account, but it doesn’t exist in the corporate directory, such as external collaborators.

  7. Perform one of the following actions described in the [Connect a business hub for your app](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9046120-connect-a-business-hub-for-your-app) article for unmatched users:
