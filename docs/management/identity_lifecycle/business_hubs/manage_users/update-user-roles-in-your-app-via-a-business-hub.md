# Update user roles in your app via a business hub

{% hint style="info" %}

**IMPORTANT:** You cannot update user roles individually if they have shared access to a business hub integration through a team. In this case, you must update the role of the corresponding team. The instructions are different depending on how the teams were created in Cerby:

* Self-managed teams

* IdP-managed teams
