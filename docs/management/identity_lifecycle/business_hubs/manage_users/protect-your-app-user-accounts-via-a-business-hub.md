# Turn on MFA for user accounts

When you turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for a user account via a business hub, verification codes are filled automatically when users log in through the Cerby web app or Cerby browser extension. When logging in on a mobile device, you must use the operating system’s autofill capability to fill in verification codes through the Cerby mobile app on iOS and Android.

To turn on MFA automatically for an app user account, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
  2. Select the **Business Hubs** option from the left menu. The **Business Hubs** page is displayed.
  3. Click the **More options** (<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1723569457/ff3ed96428e90036ff869ca5d786/5b3ec0c0-5a2c-4405-b8b9-222105874cb0?expires=1764234000&signature=8fd63fd8e13e4c83c01edbb25923ec5e7c40e526672eba7126731c30ff66a45e&req=dSclFcx4lIVaXvMW3Hu4gbwQe8BKujOdFO0umotvmm4lHtW%2FWF%2BZ8pJvHSws%0Aqw%3D%3D%0A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>) icon of the corresponding business hub card.
