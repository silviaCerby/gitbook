# Add users and teams to your apps via a business hub

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Business hub **Owners**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** , you can add users to your external seat-based and paid social apps through Cerby.

The process of adding users involves sharing the business hub integration with one or multiple users and teams, and assigning roles both in the integration and in the external app, including assets if supported.

**IMPORTANT:** To start protecting and managing user access from Cerby, the new users must accept the invitation and join the external app. For instructions, read the article [Join your external app and set up your business hub access](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-web-app/business-hubs/join-your-external-app-and-set-up-your-business-hub-access).

  10. Click the **Next** button. The **Define Access** dialog box is displayed.
  11. Select the option of the corresponding access level of the users on the app:

     * **Invite user to <app name>: **It means users can join the app with an assigned seat and manage the app settings in Cerby.
     * **Share only business hub in Cerby:** It means users can access and manage the app settings in Cerby without assigning a seat.
​**NOTE:** The **Share only business hub in Cerby** access level is only enabled when selecting Owner as the user’s role.

  12. Click the **Next** button. The**Define App Role** dialog box is displayed.
  13. Select the corresponding access role of the users and teams from the **Application Role** list.
**NOTE:** Access roles are different depending on the app’s native roles and permissions.

  14. (Optional) Assign the assets to share with the users and teams by completing the following steps:
     1. Click the **Next** button. The **Assign assets** dialog box is displayed.
     2. Select the assets you want to grant access to the users and teams.
     3. Select the role options you want to assign to the users and teams:

        * **Partial access:** It means users can only perform the selected actions on the asset.
​**NOTE:** The actions that users and teams can perform on an asset differ depending on the app.

        * **Full access:** It means users can perform all the supported actions on the asset.

  15. Click the**Share** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed. The new users and teams are displayed in the table in the**User Overview** section.

Now you are done.
