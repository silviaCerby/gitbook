    The Cerby API implements a set of rules and protocols that enable your
    company’s custom applications to communicate with our platform. To interact
    with our API, you must send a request to a specific endpoint, which our API
    processes to return a JSON-encoded response.

  - name: Accounts
    description: >-
      In Cerby, accounts are digital records that contain user login information
      for a particular app or service provider. An **`account`** object contains
      information about the account label, the app to which the account belongs,
      the password, the dates when the account was created and last updated, and
      the user who created and last updated the account.

      Additionally, an `account_secret` object contains information about the
      account’s password.


      The **`account`** and **`account_secret`** objects are created in Cerby
      when you perform any of the following actions:


      * Add an account manually through the Cerby web app or mobile app.  

      * Autosave an account at login or signup through the Cerby browser
      extension  

      * Import items from your password manager.


      With the Cerby API, you can retrieve all accounts or specific accounts by

      [Accounts](https://help.cerby.com/en/collections/5819904-accounts) article
      collection on the Cerby Help Center.


      > **Important:** 

      > You can only retrieve accounts to which you have the **Owner** role.
      Your permissions are determined by your API key based on Cerby’s RBAC
      system.
  - name: Secrets
    description: >-
      In Cerby, secrets are encrypted digital records that contain sensitive

      Admin**, or **Owner** role. Your permissions are determined by your API
      key based on Cerby’s RBAC system.
  - name: Jobs
    description: >-
      In Cerby, jobs are the automated workflows performed server-side by the
      Cerby agent either through API requests or interactions on a headless
      browser. The goal of these jobs is to protect user accounts and manage
      user access to seat-based and paid social apps. A **`job`** object
      contains information about the type of automation job, the provider, if it
      can be retried, the user who created the job, the job status, and other
      relevant attributes.

  - name: Vaults
    description: >-
      In Cerby, vaults are secure spaces for storing and managing your account
      data and sensitive information, such as secrets. They provide an
      additional layer of protection by implementing encryption and access
      controls to ensure that only authorized users can access the stored data.


      A <code>vault</code> object is created in Cerby when you perform the
      following actions:


      * Create and configure a Cerby workspace. This action creates a default
      cloud vault for the workspace.

      * Create additional local vaults in your Cerby workspace.


      With the Cerby API, you can list all the vaults in your workspace. To
      learn more about vaults, refer to the [Managing your
      vaults](https://help.cerby.com/en/collections/6328971-managing-your-vaults)
      article collection on the Cerby Help Center.


      > **Important:**

      > * You can only retrieve vaults if you have the workspace <b>Admin</b>,
      <b>Super Admin</b>, or <b>Owner</b> role. Your permissions are determined
      by your API key based on Cerby’s RBAC system.</li>

      > * You can retrieve cloud vaults using the Cerby API, but not local
      vaults.</li>
  - name: Integrations
    description: >

      In Cerby, integrations are the connections between seat-based and paid
      social apps with a Cerby workspace. The goal is to enable companies to
      centralize in Cerby the lifecycle management of user accounts within these
      apps, characterized by having collaboration spaces (workspaces, teams, or
      dashboards) and individual seats or licenses for user access. The
      connection is based on API requests or automated jobs.


      Depending on the API endpoint, you can retrieve any of the following two
      objects from an integration:


      * **`integration` object:** Contains information about the app connected
      to Cerby, the date when the integration was created, the user who created
      and last updated the account, and other relevant attributes.

      * **`entitlement` object:** Contains information about the available user
      roles in the app or the roles assigned to a user. In the second case, the
      **entitlement** object is an attribute of a user object.


      A `business-hub` object is created in Cerby when you connect an
      integration through the Cerby web app, whereas an `entitlement` object is
      created in response to a specific request you make to the Cerby API.


      With the Cerby API, you can retrieve specific integrations by providing
      their ID, the available entitlements, all the users in an integrations,
      and specific users in an integration by providing their ID. Also, you can
      update the entitlements of a user in an integration.


      To learn more about integrations, refer to the [Business
      Hubs](https://help.cerby.com/en/collections/5820019-business-hubs) article
      collection on the Cerby Help Center.
