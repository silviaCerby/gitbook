**IMPORTANT:** Cerby does not display the API key because it was hashed and stored; you can only view its name, the dates when it was created and last used, and its expiration date. You can also [update its scopes](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9950704-update-the-scopes-of-an-api-key).


{% endhint %}

Now you are done.
