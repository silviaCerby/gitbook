{% hint style="danger" %} **IMPORTANT:** Cerby does not display the API key
because it was hashed and stored; you can only view its name, the dates when
it was created and last used, and its expiration date. You can also [update
its scopes](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9950704-update-the-scopes-of-

Now you are done.
