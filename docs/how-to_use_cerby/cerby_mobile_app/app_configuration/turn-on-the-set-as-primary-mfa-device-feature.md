As a user of the Cerby mobile app, you can enable the **Set as primary MFA device** feature to set a primary device for the following flows within the app:

  * **Receiving multi-factor authentication (MFA) push notifications:** MFA push notifications are sent to the current mobile device, even if you are logged in on multiple mobile devices.
  * **Enables biometric challenges for secrets on mobile:** When a secret requires an identity challenge, Cerby prompts Face ID or Touch ID on iOS and Face Lock or Fingerprint recognition on Android on the mobile device so that you can view the secret in the app.

  1. Open the Cerby mobile app on your phone.
  2. Log in to your Cerby workspace.
  3. Tap the profile icon. The **My Profile** screen appears.
