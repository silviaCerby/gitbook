## Key concepts

* This video shows you how to log in to your accounts manually when you cannot use the Cerby mobile app to autofill your credentials because the Cerby mobile app doesn’t detect the input fields, or the [Allow Autofill](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-mobile-app/app-configuration/turn-on-the-allow-autofill-feature) feature is not turned on.
