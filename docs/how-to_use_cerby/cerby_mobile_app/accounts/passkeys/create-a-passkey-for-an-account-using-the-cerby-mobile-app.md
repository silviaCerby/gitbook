## Create a passkey for an account using the Cerby mobile app

To create a passkey for an account using the Cerby mobile app, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to the app with the account you want to add the passkey to.
  2. Access the account login and authentication settings within the app.
  3. Select the option to add a new passkey. A menu is displayed with the list of passkey managers on your phone.

  **IMPORTANT:** On Android, if this is your first time using a third-party passkey manager, the OS may not immediately display it in the menu. After you've set Cerby as a provider and used it before, it will appear more readily as a pre-selected option or as a direct alternative in the menu.

  4. Select the **Cerby** option.
  5. Tap the **Continue** button. The phone’s biometric verification, face ID or Touch ID on iOS, and face lock or fingerprint recognition on Android is activated.

     * If the verification is successful, the **Create Passkey** screen is displayed.
     * If you didn’t turn on the [Biometrics Login](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-mobile-app/app-configuration/turn-on-the-biometrics-login-feature) feature for the Cerby mobile app previously, the **Turn on Face ID to unlock Passkeys** screen is displayed. In this case, ensure to turn on the feature to continue.

  6. Select if you want to add the passkey to a new or existing account:

     * For an existing account

       1. Select the account in the **Update existing account** section of the **Create passkey** screen.

     * For a new account

       1. Select the account in the **Create new item for <app name>** section. The **Create Account** screen is displayed.
       2. Fill in the information about the new account.

       **IMPORTANT:** Ensure the username is unique, meaning two accounts cannot have the same username.

  7. Tap the **Save** option. A success message is displayed on the screen.

Now you are done.
