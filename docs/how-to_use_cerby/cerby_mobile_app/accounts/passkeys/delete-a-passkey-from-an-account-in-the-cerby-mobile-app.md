**IMPORTANT:** Consider the following important notes:

* If you remove a passkey directly in the app, Cerby does not automatically detect this action or delete it from your account information. To manage your passkeys in Cerby, you must delete them directly within the Cerby mobile app.
* Before deleting a passkey from Cerby, ensure to first delete it directly in the app. Cerby does not automatically remove the passkey in the app. To properly delete the passkey, ensure it is removed from the app first.
