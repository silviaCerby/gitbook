As an account **Owner** , you can update other teams’ roles on your accounts using the Cerby mobile app. The roles you can select for teams are **Owner** or **Collaborator** , and this role propagates to all team members.

To update a team’s role on an account, you must complete the following steps using the Cerby mobile app:

1. Open the Cerby mobile app on your phone.
2. Log in to your Cerby workspace.
3. Tap the corresponding account card. The account details screen is displayed.
4. Tap the right arrow icon from the **Teams** list within the **Sharing** section. The **View teams** screen is displayed.
5. Select the corresponding team from the list. A menu is displayed at the bottom.
6. Tap the **Update role** button from the menu. The list of roles is displayed.
7. Select the team’s new role on the account:

   * **Owner:** Teams can share accounts, manage access and account configuration, and view passwords through the user interface (UI) and API responses.
   * **Collaborator:** Teams can only view passwords through API responses for login through Cerby, and their access through the UI is restricted.

8. Tap the **Save** button.

Now you are done.
