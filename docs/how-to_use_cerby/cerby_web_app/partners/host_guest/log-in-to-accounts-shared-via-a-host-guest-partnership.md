# Log in to accounts shared via a host-guest partnership

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Users**
* Available to Cerby Automate
* Supported using the Cerby web app, browser extension, and mobile app


{% endhint %}

All guest workspace members with shared access to accounts from the host workspace can log in to these accounts through Cerby, regardless of their role (**Collaborator** or **Manager**).

Access the accounts as you normally would via the account cards in the dashboard of the Cerby web app, browser extension, and mobile app.

In the Cerby web app dashboard, the accounts shared via a host-guest partnership are displayed in the **All accounts** view with the initial letter of the workspace name beside the app logo, as shown in **Figure 1**.
