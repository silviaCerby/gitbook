# [Video] How to join a local partner as a guest user

## Key concepts

* A [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners) enables **Guest Users** to join a subgroup or organization within a workspace to receive shared access to the accounts they need for collaboration.
* **Guest Admins** of a local partner must follow the process to join a workspace as **Guest Users**.
* After joining a Cerby workspace, all **Guest Users** must set up a trusted session for their devices and turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA). For instructions, read the following articles:

  1. [Set up trusted sessions on your devices](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/workspace-configuration/trusted-devices/set-up-trusted-sessions-on-your-devices)
  2. [Turn on MFA for your Cerby account](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/identity-providers-idps/local-workspace/create-and-configure-a-local-user-workspace)

* Access to accounts shared by **Host Admins** via a local partner is granted as follows:
  * **Guest Admins** are granted the **Collaborator** or **Manager** role on the accounts. As **Managers** , they can share these accounts with other **Guest Users**. For instructions, see the video [How to share an account via a local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/workspace-configuration/user-management/partners/video-how-to-share-an-account-via-a-local-partner).
  * **Guest Users** are only granted the **Collaborator** role.
