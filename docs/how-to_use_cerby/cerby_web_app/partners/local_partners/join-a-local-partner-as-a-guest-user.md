# Join a local partner as a Guest User

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Guest Admins** and**Guest Users** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As an external collaborator, you can join an existing [local partner](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-partners) in a Cerby workspace to receive shared access to the accounts you need to work with your partner. The process to join a local partner is the same whether you have been assigned the **Guest Admin** or **Guest User** role.

You can do the following in the local partnership according to your role:

* **Guest User:** You can only view and receive access to accounts that a **Host Admin** shares with the local partner.
* **Guest Admin:** You can invite and manage **Guest Users** in the local partner and share accounts with them, but only if you were granted the account **Manager** role.

To join a local partner as a **Guest User** , you must complete the following steps:

  1. Open the email you received with the invitation to join Cerby. The message contains the following account details you need to set up your account:

     * **Workspace name**
     * **Username**
     * **Temporary password**

  2. Click the **Join as a guest** button in the email. An authentication waiting page is displayed on a new browser tab.
**IMPORTANT:** Proceed to step 3 immediately, as you will be redirected to the authentication page of the identity provider set up for the Cerby workspace after a few seconds. You’ll be unable to set up your account on that page; therefore, you must close the browser tab and follow step 2 again.

  3. Click the **Log in as a guest user** button. The Cerby authentication page is displayed.
  4. Enter the username and temporary password in the corresponding fields. These account details were provided in the message that Cerby emailed you.
  5. Click the **Sign In** button. The **Change Password** page is displayed.
  6. Enter the corresponding information in the following fields:

     * **New Password:** It is the password you will use to log into Cerby. It must be different from the password you received in the email and follow the password policies shown on the page.
     * **Enter New Password Again:** It is the new password once again.
     * **Name:** It is your name.
     * **Family Name:** It is your last name.

  7. Click the **Send** button. The Cerby web app dashboard and the **Terms of service agreement** dialog box are displayed.
  8. Select the **I confirm that I have read, consent, and agree to Cerby’s Terms of Service** option.
  9. Click the **Continue** button. The dialog box closes.
  10. Set up your account and access to Cerby by completing the following steps:
     1. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your Cerby user account. For instructions, read the article [Turn on MFA for your Cerby account](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/identity-providers-idps/local-workspace/create-and-configure-a-local-user-workspace).
     2. Install the Cerby client apps approved by your company. For instructions, read the article [Install the Cerby mobile app and browser extension](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/identity-providers-idps/local-workspace/create-and-configure-a-local-user-workspace).
     3. Set up trusted sessions on the devices you will use to access Cerby. For instructions, read the article [Set up trusted sessions on your devices](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/workspace-configuration/trusted-devices/set-up-trusted-sessions-on-your-devices).

Now you are done.
