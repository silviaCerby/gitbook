**Description:** This article describes how an external collaborator can join a Cerby workspace from a guest user invite sent to their email.

{% hint style="info" %} **Who can use this feature?** * Workspace**Guest
Users** * Supported using the Cerby web app {% endhint %}

As a guest user, you receive an email to set up your Cerby account and join a
workspace through the web app.

To join Cerby from a guest user invite, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Open the message Cerby sent to your email address. The message contains the following account details you need to set up your account:

     * **Workspace name**

     * **Username**

     * **Temporary password**

  2. Click the **Open Cerby** button from the message. An authentication waiting page is displayed in your web browser

**IMPORTANT:** Proceed to step 3 right away because, after a few seconds, you
are redirected to the corporate identity provider’s login page. You cannot set
up your account on that page; therefore, you must close the browser tab and
follow step 2 again.

  3. Click the **Log in as guest user** button, as shown in **Figure 1**.
