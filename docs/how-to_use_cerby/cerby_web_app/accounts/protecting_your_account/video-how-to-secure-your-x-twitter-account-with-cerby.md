# [Video] How to secure your X (Twitter) account with Cerby

# Key concepts

  * Cerby will be set up as an authenticator app for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide verification codes each time you or your coworkers with shared access log in to your X (Twitter) account.
  * A Cerby-managed email address and phone number will be associated with your X account to streamline login and automation tasks.
  * Make sure you have turned off MFA.

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever you make changes to your account settings in X, such as updating your associated email address and phone number, the change takes 24 hours to propagate. During that time, your account settings will be restricted, so you will have to wait to make additional changes.
