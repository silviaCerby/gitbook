# [Video] How to secure your Snapchat account with Cerby

## Key concepts

* Cerby will be set up as an authenticator app for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide verification codes each time you or your coworkers with shared access log in to your Snapchat account.
* A Cerby-managed email address and phone number will be associated with your Snapchat account to streamline login and automation tasks.
* Make sure you have turned off MFA.

**IMPORTANT:** The setup can only be performed through the Snapchat app using your mobile phone.
