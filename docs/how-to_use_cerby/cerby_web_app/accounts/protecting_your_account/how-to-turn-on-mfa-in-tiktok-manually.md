# How to turn on MFA in TikTok manually

The Cerby platform has a central feature that enables users to automatically turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their accounts with service providers. This feature adds an extra layer of security to authentication processes.

However, not all service providers support automation for turning on MFA from Cerby. In these cases, users must manually configure MFA in the platforms of their service providers.

This article describes the steps to configure MFA in TikTok manually using a Cerby-managed phone number and email address.

## Requirements

The following are the requirements to turn on MFA in TikTok:

* An account in Cerby with an **Account Owner** role.
* A TikTok account onboarded in Cerby.
* An active account on TikTok.
* The TikTok mobile application installed on your mobile phone.
**IMPORTANT:** You cannot configure MFA in TikTok using a browser; you must use the TikTok mobile application. However, to create and configure a Cerby-managed email address and phone number, use a browser on your desktop computer or laptop.

## Turning on MFA in TikTok

To configure MFA in TikTok, you must complete two main steps from the TikTok mobile application:

  1. Link verification methods
  2. Turn on MFA

The following sections describe each main step.

## 1\. Link verification methods

Depending on how you signed up for a TikTok account, you may have configured a phone number or email address, or even turned on MFA. Regardless of what you have configured, you must first link these verification methods to a Cerby-managed phone number and email address before turning on MFA.

To link the verification methods, complete the following steps:

  1. Open the TikTok application on your mobile phone with your account.
  2. Tap the **Profile** button located on the right in the bottom navigation drawer. A screen with your profile is displayed.
  3. Tap the **Menu** icon located at the top right of the screen. A drop-down menu is displayed.
  4. Tap the **Settings and privacy** option from the list. The **Settings and privacy** screen is displayed.
  5. Tap the **Account** button located in the **Account** section. The **Account** screen is displayed.
  6. Tap the **Account information** button. The **Account information** screen is displayed with the **Phone number** and **Email** fields. Depending on the values of these fields, you must complete one or both of the following steps:

     * **Link a new verification method.** It applies when the **Phone number** or **Email** fields, or both, don’t display any value.
     * **Change a verification method.** It applies when the **Phone number** or **Email** fields, or both, display their corresponding value, and this value is not a Cerby-managed phone number or email address.
The following sections describe the steps of each alternative.
