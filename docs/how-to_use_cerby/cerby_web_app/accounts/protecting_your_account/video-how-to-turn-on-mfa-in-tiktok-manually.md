# [Video] How to turn on MFA in TikTok manually

**Key Concepts:**

* Cerby recommends configuring email-based MFA for TikTok accounts using a Cerby-managed email.
* If you have an already existing email configured on your TikTok account, you will need to off-board the existing email first. This involves receiving and confirming a code sent to the email on file.
* After a Cerby-managed email has been configured on the TikTok account, you will select "password" and "email" as the two factors for the TikTok account.
