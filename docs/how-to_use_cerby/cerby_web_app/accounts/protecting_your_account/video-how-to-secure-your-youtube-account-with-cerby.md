# [Video] How to secure your YouTube account with Cerby

# Key concepts

  * Cerby will be set up as an authenticator app for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide verification codes each time you or your coworkers with shared access log in to your YouTube account.
  * A Cerby-managed phone number will be associated with your Google account for MFA to streamline login and automation tasks, while a Cerby-managed email address will be optionally set up as a recovery email.
  * Make sure you have turned off MFA.
