# View the messages sent to a Cerby-managed email address or phone number

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users**
* **Account Owners and Collaborators**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app

**IMPORTANT:** If you use local vaults, you must have already set up at least one [trusted session](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/workspace-configuration/trusted-devices/set-up-trusted-sessions-on-your-devices) on your devices.


{% endhint %}

As an account **Owner** or **Collaborator** , you can seamlessly view all messages sent to Cerby-managed email addresses or phone numbers associated with your accounts.

Every email and SMS message for general contact or multi-factor authentication (MFA) verification codes is automatically routed to your dedicated in-platform Shared Inbox. This inbox centralizes all your account-related digital communications in one secure place.

While Cerby automatically retrieves verification codes from this inbox to perform automated logins for you and all users with shared access to the account, you can also access it to view the messages and, if needed, forward emails to other recipients. For more information, read the article [Forward a message from your Cerby inbox](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/how-to-use-cerby/cerby-web-app/accounts/protecting-your-account/forward-a-message-from-your-cerby-inbox).

## View the messages sent to a Cerby-managed email address or phone number

You can view the messages sent to a Cerby-managed email address or phone number in the following two ways:

  * [Shared Inbox](view-the-messages-sent-to-a-cerby-managed-email-address-or-phone-number.md#id-shared-inbox)
  * [Account inbox](view-the-messages-sent-to-a-cerby-managed-email-address-or-phone-number.md#id-account-inbox)

The following sections describe each way.

### Shared Inbox

The Shared Inbox is the container of all the messages sent to all Cerby-managed email addresses and phone numbers associated with accounts. This inbox displays a table with the latest messages, and you can filter the results by app, account, collection, and type.

  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

The **Shared Inbox** page is displayed with a table of messages.
