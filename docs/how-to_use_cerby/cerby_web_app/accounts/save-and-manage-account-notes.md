# Save and manage account notes

With Cerby, you have a secure way to save additional information about your accounts.

The Account Notes feature enables you to add information to your account data, making it visible to other users with shared access to the account. Instead of adding an individual [secret](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-secrets), you can use the **Notes** field to save text-based information such as the following:

* Expiration dates for your licenses
* The point of contact for more information about licenses
* The tenant to which the account or license belongs
* Reminders

Only users with the **Account Owner** role on an account can add and edit a note, and both **Account Owners** and **Account Collaborators** can view the note of a shared account.

Account notes can be imported to Cerby from your password notes in LastPass. For more information, read the [How to use the Password Manager Importer](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/management/credential-management/item-importer/migrate-from-lastpass-to-cerby) article.

The Account Notes feature is available for any account and user within a Cerby workspace. The **Notes** field is accessible through the account details page using the Cerby web app.
