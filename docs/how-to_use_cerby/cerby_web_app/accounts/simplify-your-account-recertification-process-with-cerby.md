# Simplify your account recertification process with Cerby

With Cerby, you can streamline compliance with corporate security policies for your social media accounts and paid social apps.

We’ve released the **Recertification** feature to empower your organization to centrally and regularly verify that all your accounts and apps are configured and protected in accordance with your security guidelines. Without recertification, your organization and critical resources are vulnerable to potential security threats.

This feature leverages the comprehensive visibility and control that Cerby provides on your accounts and business hubs, including who accesses and manages them. With the recertification centralized in Cerby, IT admins and auditors can oversee the process, and account **Owners** can track and complete the necessary steps in one place.

The following are some of the benefits of the Recertification feature:

* Regulating access controls, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access and safeguarding your organization’s sensitive data.
* Ensuring consistent adherence to internal security policies, helping your organization stay aligned with best practices and regulatory standards.
* Reinforcing trust using Cerby’s robust security and effective user management, giving users peace of mind and a stronger sense of reliability.

The following are specific benefits for account **Owners** :

* Gaining visibility on the account recertification progress and due dates to stay on track with pending items.
* Centralizing account access reviews and reducing the need for time-consuming manual efforts.
* Having immediate access to clear action items needed to meet compliance criteria.
