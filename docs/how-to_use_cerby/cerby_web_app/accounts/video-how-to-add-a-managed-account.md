# [Video] How to add a managed account

**Key Concepts:**

* Do not trigger automation until Cerby manages at least two “factors” for an account. One factor is always the password.
* Other factors include the email, phone number, or two-factor itself (via the Cerby Authenticator app, a Cerby-managed email, or Cerby-managed phone).
