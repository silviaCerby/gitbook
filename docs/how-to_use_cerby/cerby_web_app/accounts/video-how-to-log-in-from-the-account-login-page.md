# [Video] How to log in from the account login page

**Key Concepts:**

* If this is a [managed account](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-accounts), Cerby initiates an automated login from the login page of the account.
* if this is a [self-managed account](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-accounts), you must populate each field using the Cerby browser extension.
