# Claim access to a business hub and assets

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

  * Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , **Users** , and **Guest Users**
  * Collection and business hub **Owners** and **Collaborators**
  * Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a business hub **Owner** or **Collaborator** , you can claim access to a business hub and assets after they were shared with you via a collection.

The goal of the claim access flow is to trigger and execute the automation jobs to create your user account and invite you to join an external app when you are ready. This way, Cerby helps you and your IT admins to prevent invites from expiring.

{% hint style="info" %}


**NOTE:** When only claiming access to assets, Cerby executes automation jobs to invite you both to the external app and to the assets because they typically follow a hierarchical structure.


{% endhint %}

To claim access to a business hub and assets, you must complete the following steps after receiving an invite email from Cerby:

  1. Open the invite email that Cerby sent you.
  2. Click the **Go to Cerby** button in the email. A new browser tab is displayed, redirecting you to the **All Accounts** page in the Cerby web app dashboard.
  3. Click the account card that corresponds to the business hub and has the “Claim your invite” status. A dialog box for claiming access is displayed.

**NOTE:** Collection and business hub **Owners** who don’t need a seat can skip the process by clicking the **Skip** button in the dialog box. For more information and instructions, read the section Skip claiming access to a business hub.

  4. Click the **Send email invite** button. The **Review your email** dialog box is displayed, and Cerby triggers an automation job to add you to the external app.

The job may take some time to complete. When it’s done, you receive an invite email from the external app.

  5. Join the app and set up your business hub access by following the instructions in the article [Join your external app and set up your business hub access](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9046232-join-your-external-app-and-set-up-your-business-hub-access).

Now you are done.

# Skip claiming access to a business hub

Collection and business hub **Owners** can skip claiming access. This feature is helpful for IT admins who need oversight or want to manage users and access through Cerby but don’t need a license or seat in the external app.

To skip claiming access to a business hub, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Open the invite email that Cerby sent you.
  2. Click the **Go to Cerby** button in the email. A new browser tab is displayed, redirecting you to the **All Accounts** page in the Cerby web app dashboard.
  3. Click the account card that corresponds to the business hub and has the “Claim your invite” status. A dialog box for claiming access is displayed.
  4. Click the **Skip** button. A confirmation dialog box is displayed.
  5. Click the **Skip for now** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message is displayed.

Now you are done.
