# [Video] How to add and share a secret

## Key concepts

* Any user, no matter their role, can add a secret in Cerby, and they become **Owners**.
* You can configure an identity challenge to be issued when users with shared access to the secret want to view it.
* For more information on the supported file sizes and format of attachments, read the [Specifications](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-secrets) section in the [How to use Secrets](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-secrets) article.
