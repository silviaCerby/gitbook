# Activate or deactivate account autosave in the Cerby browser extension

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users**
* Only supported using the browser extension


{% endhint %}

As a workspace member with any role, except **Guest users** and **Login-Only** , you can activate or deactivate the account autosave feature to control whether the **Add a new account to Cerby** dialog box appears when logging in or signing up for an account through its website.

{% hint style="danger" %}


**IMPORTANT:** This feature may be restricted by your workspace **Admin** for all workspace members by the following settings:

* **Prompted autosave:** When logging in or signing up for an account in allowed domains configured in the workspace, a prompt dialog box asks whether you want to save your credentials to Cerby. You can choose to save or skip the account autosave.
* **Enforced autosave:** When you log in or sign up for an account in a specified domain, Cerby automatically saves the credentials.

For more information, read the article [Explore account autosave](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-account-autosave).
