# Manage the domains where Cerby prompts you to autosave your accounts

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super** **Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users**
* Supported using the Cerby web app and browser extension


{% endhint %}

As a user in Cerby with any role, except **Guest User** and **Login-Only** , you can manage the **Add a new account to Cerby** dialog box that prompts you to autosave a new account each time you enter your credentials on login and signup pages for specific domains.

By default, this dialog box offers a quick and convenient way to save your account credentials without manually filling in all the information through Cerby. However, if you prefer not to see this dialog box for specific domains, you can select the **Don't ask to save for this website again** option, preventing the dialog box from appearing on subsequent login and signup attempts.

The domains for which you select this option are added to your profile's **Do not save** list. You can access this list and remove websites to re-enable the dialog box for those domains.

{% hint style="danger" %}


**IMPORTANT:** Your workspace **Admin** can set a list of denied or allowed domains for the workspace, which could limit the settings you can configure for the autosave feature.


{% endhint %}

The following are the actions you can perform to manage the account autosave settings:

* Disable the **Add a new account to Cerby** dialog box
* View the **Do not save** list
* Remove domains from the **Do not save** list

The following sections describe each action.

## Disable the Add a new account to Cerby dialog box

When you log in or sign up for an account on a specific website, the Cerby browser extension displays the **Add a new account to Cerby** dialog box with your pre-filled login information, including the website name, username, and password. You can fill in the rest of the fields and save that information into Cerby as an account.

To disable that dialog box each time you log in or sign up for a website, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Open the login or signup page of the website you want to access.
  2. Enter your login credentials.
  3. Click the login or signup button on the page. The Cerby browser extension displays the **Add a new account to Cerby** dialog box.
  4. Click the **Don’t ask to save for this website again** option, as shown in **Figure 1**.
