# [Video] How to scout a workflow

## Key concepts

* Scout by Cerby is a browser extension that accelerates and improves the building process of automated tasks. This extension captures how you interact with a web browser tab when performing the following manual business workflows:
  * Log in to your account
  * Update your account's password
  * Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  * Invite a user to your app
  * Remove a user from your app
  * Update a user's role in your app
* For workflow scouting tips and information about what data is captured, read the article [Explore Scout](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-scout).

**IMPORTANT:** To successfully use Scout, take the following into consideration:

* Make sure your organization was invited by Cerby to access and install Scout through the Chrome Web Store. [Scout by Cerby](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scout-by-cerby/dknnopjbgccecedcmkfjlmenbagocmnh?authuser=1) is privately listed.
* Make sure you have generated an API key that enables you to log in to Scout and send your scouting report to Cerby. Only workspace **Admins** and **Super Admins** can generate an API key through the Cerby web app. This key must have the following scopes:
  * **Read automated jobs**
  * **Write automated jobs**
For instructions, read the article [Generate an API key](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/extending-cerby/public-api/generate-an-api-key).
