By default, Scout keeps you logged in at all times until you manually log out. To log out from the [Scout browser extension](https://cerby-test.gitbook.io/cerby-test/support-and-use-cases/explore/explore-scout), you must complete the following steps:

1. Open the Scout browser extension. The **Scout your workflows** screen is displayed.
2. Click the **More options** icon (<img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/pc0ldyqu/1229256833/b4a73926692e4851ac00d4fdcdea/AD_4nXe3YzXyHGIU8oP3SfdSfiGWX-BfX5aBh0vNY58GV81LQkHB5lmY5wYHGnP2nXpjK5hKNT4ZYMeIizhjTeDVH9CyqsEf2m7B3avbUHRyHakl0vy06nTKXclApewLiVK13jiUJm2E2gtVZr5mvvE1zwWUYfpp?expires=1744956000&signature=4a3c609e655d6124707098ada66ad1fe40bcaf832e233e323bd9007e00b9ea5a&req=dSIlH8t7m4lcWvMW3Hu4gWyQyVp9GQ60X6xWi7hd7%2B0BY8LGLvy%2FG8KHTBHN%0Avg%3D%3D%0A" alt="">) button located at the top right side of the extension popup. A drop-down list is displayed.
3. Select the **Log out** option. Scout logs you out of the session and the **Welcome to Scout!** popup is displayed.

**IMPORTANT:** You must enter an API key each time you log in to Scout. Make sure the token has not expired; otherwise, you must generate and enter a new one.

Now you’re done.
