# Explore Push Notifications

With Cerby’s push notifications, you can receive real-time alerts directly in your Cerby dashboard. When you enable this feature, Cerby immediately notifies you whenever a new trusted device is added to your workspace, enabling you to approve or deny access with just a single tap, ensuring you're always in control.

The following are some of the benefits you get by turning on push notifications:

* **Immediate visibility:** Get a prompt notification when a device is onboarded, rather than discovering it later through your profile.
* **One-tap approval:** Review the device details and approve or reject new trusted devices directly from the notification.

**NOTE:** At the moment, Cerby shows notifications when onboarding a new trusted device.

## How push notifications work

With Cerby’s push notifications, the process to onboard a new trusted device is simplified as follows:

  1. Turn on push notifications in your Cerby dashboard.
  2. When Cerby detects an onboarding request from an unrecognized device, it automatically sends you a push notification directly to your Cerby dashboard, as shown in **Figure 1**.

  3. Click the notification buttons to approve or reject the new device:

     * **Approve:** Adds the device to your trusted list and finishes onboarding.
     * **Deny:** Rejects the onboarding of the new device and keeps its session as not trusted.

And, that’s it.
