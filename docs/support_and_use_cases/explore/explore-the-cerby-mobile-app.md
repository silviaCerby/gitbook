# Explore the Cerby mobile app

With the Cerby mobile app, you can manage your accounts, secrets, and collections, log in to your accounts, and perform multi-factor authentication (MFA) tasks directly from your iOS or Android phone.

If you are familiar with the Cerby web app, the mobile app acts as an extension. This client app enables you to access all the information, settings, and security features of your Cerby workspace from your phone.

You can also use the mobile app independently because it provides the features needed to manage your accounts, secrets, and collections while integrating security and ensuring that your sensitive information remains protected.

The Cerby mobile app is built using best practices for iOS and Android platforms, ensuring a secure and reliable experience regardless of your device.

The layout is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that you can find what you need with just a few taps. Whether you're looking to quickly log in to an account or update your authentication methods, the dashboard makes it all accessible, as shown in **Figure 1**.
