# Perform a hard refresh on a web page

When updating or troubleshooting Cerby‑related content, a web page refresh is commonly required to reflect the most recent changes. A regular page refresh might not reflect these changes because browsers store assets such as style sheets, scripts, and images to improve performance. In these cases, you may need to perform a hard refresh to fetch a clean copy of the page from the server.

The following is the difference between a regular and hard refresh in a browser:

  * **Regular refresh:** Reloads the page but might use cached resources.
  * **Hard refresh:** Forces the browser to clear the cache for that page and reload everything from scratch.

The following are the cases for which you can use a hard refresh on a web page:

  * You’re not seeing recent updates to Cerby.
  * Layouts or styles seem broken after changes.
  * Changes have been applied to your workspace, and they are not shown on your browser.
