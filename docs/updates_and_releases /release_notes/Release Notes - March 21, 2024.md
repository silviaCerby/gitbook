# Release Notes - March 21, 2024

**Description:** This article describes the latest enhancements and bug fixes to improve your experience using Cerby.

# New features

Here are the new features and improvements we released across the Cerby
platform:

  * Ever wanted to work seamlessly and closely with agencies or other external partners without jumping through password-sharing and other hoops? Now Cerby gives you more options! We're thrilled to announce **Local Partners**! This is another offering for secure collaboration with external parties.   
With Local Partners, you can invite external collaborators directly to your
existing Cerby workspace, streamlining access to accounts, secrets, and
collections. Ready for more? Read the article [Add a local partner to your
workspace](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/9039109-add-a-local-partner-to-
your-workspace) to learn how you can benefit from this feature.  
​**Figure 1** shows how Local Partners are presented within our **Partners**
view.

  * Talking about partners, here’s another collaboration booster. We have a new feature you cannot even find in your paid social apps, such as Meta Business Manager or TikTok for Business. We are talking about **Native Partners** , an extended functionality of our App integrations that enables you to gain visibility on the users who access the assets you have shared with your paid social partners to collaborate in ad campaigns.  
Interested? Read the [Native
partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-
partners#h_e7fa9c355c) section of the article [Explore
Partners](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners) for an
overview of this feature.  
​**Figure 2** shows the table of partners connected to an App integration for
Meta Business Manager.

dashboard with a list of connected native partners

Before you jump to the next feature, take a look at the **Guest users** tab
we’ve added to the app details page. Here, you can see all external users who
have access to your Apps, including the ones with shared access to your assets
via a native partner. Don’t miss this table to gain more control over who has
access to your items, their onboarding journey, and how they got into your
workspace.

  * Get ready for a powerful way to organize your accounts and secrets in a nested way! Cerby’s **Subcollections** makes sharing your entire item structure with other members easier. Not only that! With this feature, you can swiftly switch from LastPass to Cerby with our [Password Manager Importer](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/7217206-what-is-the-password-manager-importer) (wink, wink), securing your data migration and saving you time and frustration. Subcollections are also supported by the Cerby mobile app for Android in v1.0.147 and iOS.  
Want to unlock your account and secret organization skills? Check the article
[Explore Subcollections](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8982445-explore-
subcollections) at our help center. Meanwhile, see a preview of our
Subcollections view in **Figure 4**.

  * Heads up: **Tenants** are now **Apps** , and they have a brand new house! All of your integrations with seat-based and paid social apps are displayed in the **Apps** view, making it easier to identify and access them from the Cerby web app dashboard.  
Keep centrally managing your apps, users, and assets like a pro through Cerby,
and continue collaborating with your partners. Take a look at our article
[Explore Apps](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/6831152-explore-apps) to
know more about this redesign.

as Meta Business Manager, Amazon Seller Central, Brex, and TikTok for
Business.

  * Now, you can get your import details at your fingertips with the downloadable **CSV report**! This report gives you a detailed breakdown of all your imported collections, subcollections, accounts, and secrets from LastPass. Enjoy the effortless download with a single click. The CSV report is perfect for verifying data accuracy and completeness, identifying import errors or inconsistencies, and fostering transparency and collaboration within your team.  
We have prepared the [How to interpret the downloadable import
report](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/7175132-how-to-use-the-password-
manager-importer#h_12d0bfdded) section in our article [How to use the Password
Manager Import](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/7175132-how-to-use-the-
password-manager-importer#h_f692674294) to guide you through the status of
each imported item.  
​**Figure 6** shows the **Import report** view, where you can see the
**Download report** button at the top right.

# **Cerby web app**

Check out what’s new in our Cerby web app:

  * You spoke, and we listened! We’ve included the **Add item** button in the **All accounts** views to enable you to add or import to Cerby any of the different supported items: account, secret, and collection, as shown in **Figure 7**.

![](images/MwDfs5qOa249JPor2pDCtukcgxC1-3J_kIoZDwLDsapV3U_K7Y7OMEP6RzThdco8IHsWKARAeCCWOXmZm3a41dv4f4G3UFK4uSB5y1GssEuY7tAiE7qiWIe06mVbPX-
lf6_K_bk94se43LdS09llxJQ)

**Figure 7.** Drop-down list of items from the **Add item** button in the
**All accounts** view

  * We are all in with saving you some clicks. The experience of adding an account using the Cerby web app is now simpler and shorter. Previously, in our **Add account** wizard, you first had to select the app from a catalog and then enter the account details. Now, we’ve condensed the process into one dialog box. That’s it. Pretty cool, right? If you want instructions, read the article [Add an account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708374-add-an-account).

  * We’re excited to share that Cerby now gives you more control over your password journey! With the **Password History** feature, you can see the latest 10 passwords saved in Cerby and associated with your account.  
Quickly identify who performed a password update and when, including automated
password rotations from Cerby, and revert it if necessary. You can also
identify reused and weak passwords to take action. Remember that you can
always use the Cerby browser extension to manually generate secure passwords
in Cerby, strengthening your password hygiene and keeping your data safe!  
​  
​**Figure 8** shows the **Password history** dialog box that is displayed
after clicking the **Password History** icon from the account details page.

**Figure 8.** List of passwords in the **Password history** dialog box

  * Want to declutter your collections easily? We have the bulk deletion of items for you! When you delete a collection, you can choose whether to delete all the items inside the collection or keep the item-level access permissions for the users and teams with shared access to them.   
This feature saves time and effort, enabling you to focus on more productive
tasks. It's essential to note that when bulk deletion is employed for all
items, they are permanently deleted.

  * We've added an extra layer of protection to your account by requiring a trusted device when triggering an automatic login.

# **Cerby browser extension**

Explore the latest features in our Cerby browser extension:

  * We are overly enthusiastic about securing your accounts, but we know you may not want Cerby to be displayed in some input fields. That’s why we released in v1.0.283 a way for you to tell us where to disable the inline menu.  
Just click the Cerby icon inside the input field to display the inline menu of
the Cerby browser extension, and click the **Help** icon. You’ll see two
options:

    * **Turn off Cerby for this field:** Select this option to remove the Cerby icon and inline menu interactions in this field for future interactions.

    * **I need help:** Select this option to be redirected to the Cerby web app support chat.

  * We've fine-tuned your experience with new informative in-context alerts for errors, logouts, and expired sessions.

# **Cerby mobile app**

Dive into the newest additions to our Cerby mobile app:

  * Take control on the go! Easily update your account details using your mobile phone through the **Edit** option on the Cerby mobile app. No more needing to switch to the web app. It's all at your fingertips in Android v1.0.147!   
Keep your information accurate and up-to-date with the Cerby mobile app,
wherever you are, as shown in **Figure 9**.

**Figure 9.** **Edit** option and screen in the Cerby mobile app

  * If you are a fan of dark mode, this one's for you. The Cerby mobile app for iOS in v1.0.140 now supports dark mode to offer a comfortable and battery-friendly viewing experience.

  * Remember the big milestone we achieved in January with the fully native version of the Cerby mobile app for Android? Well, we have now accomplished the same for iOS in v1.0.131.

  * We've streamlined the **Secrets** design for a more intuitive and enjoyable experience in iOS v1.0.126 and Android v1.0.137.

  * We’re giving you a smoother experience, making our Cerby mobile app run quicker.
