# Log in to an account manually using the Cerby browser extension

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , **Users** , **Login-Only** , and **Guest Users**
* Account **Owners** and **Collaborators**
* Supported using the Cerby browser extension


{% endhint %}

As an account **Owner** or **Collaborator** , you can log in to your account manually using the Cerby browser extension.

This assisted experience is intended for scenarios where [automated login](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/13747959-log-in-to-an-account-automatically-using-the-cerby-browser-extension) cannot be completed, either because it involves a [self-managed account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_079d120056) or the app requires manual intervention due to recent user interface (UI) updates.

The following are the available options to log in manually using the Cerby browser extension:

* [Copying the login credentials from the extension popup](log-in-to-an-account-manually-using-the-cerby-browser-extension.md#copying-the-login-credentials-from-the-extension-popup)
* [Filling in the login credentials using the inline menu](log-in-to-an-account-manually-using-the-cerby-browser-extension.md#filling-in-the-login-credentials-using-the-inline-menu)

The following sections describe each option.
