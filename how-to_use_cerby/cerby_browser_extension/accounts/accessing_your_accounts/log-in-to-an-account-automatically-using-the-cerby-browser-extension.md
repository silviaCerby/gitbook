As an account **Owner** or **Collaborator** , you can log in to your account automatically using the Cerby browser extension.

This is a one-click experience where the Cerby browser extension autofills your login credentials and verification codes when multi-factor authentication (MFA) is on and managed by Cerby.

The following are the available options to log in automatically using the Cerby browser extension:

* [Auto-login from the extension popup](log-in-to-an-account-automatically-using-the-cerby-browser-extension.md#auto-login-from-the-extension-popup)
* [Auto-login from the inline menu](log-in-to-an-account-automatically-using-the-cerby-browser-extension.md#auto-login-from-the-inline-menu)

The following sections describe each option.

## Auto-login from the extension popup

To auto-login to an account from the Cerby browser extension popup, you must complete the following steps:

  1. Log in to your workspace in the Cerby browser extension. For instructions, read the article [Log in to the Cerby browser extension](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10755356-log-in-to-the-cerby-browser-extension).
  2. Hover the mouse over the corresponding account. The **Auto-login** button is displayed.
​**TIP:** To save you time, Cerby automatically tries to identify the domain of the page you have open in your browser and suggests relevant accounts at the top of the popup, under the **For this website** section.

  3. Click the **Auto-login** button. Cerby runs the automated login in the current tab or a new tab, depending on whether the domain was identified.

Now you are done.
