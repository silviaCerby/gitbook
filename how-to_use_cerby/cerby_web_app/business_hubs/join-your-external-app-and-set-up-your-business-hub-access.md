# Join your external app and set up your business hub access

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Business hub **Collaborators**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a business hub **Collaborator** who receives an invite to join a seat-based or paid social app through a business hub, you must accept the invite, create a user account in the external app, and connect this account to the business hub.

The goal is to centralize and protect your access to your external app through Cerby.

**NOTE:** If you log in to your app using single sign-on (SSO) authentication with your identity provider, you don’t need to connect your account to a business hub in Cerby.


{% endhint %}

To join your external app and set up your business hub access, you must complete the following steps:

1. Join the external app and set up your user account by completing the following steps:
  1. Open the invite email that the external app sent you.
  2. Follow the instructions in the email to join the app and set up your user account.
​**TIP:** Use the Cerby browser extension to generate a strong and secure [password](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8377075-generate-secure-passwords-using-the-cerby-browser-extension).

2. Add your user account to Cerby and connect it to the business hub by completing the following steps:
  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
  2. Click the **Log in** button of the account card that corresponds to the external apps and has the “Connect your account” status. A dialog box is displayed.
  3. Enter the details of the user account that you have just set up:

     * **Account label in Cerby:** It is the name of your account in Cerby, which is displayed on the account card.
     * **Email:** It is the email address associated with your account.
     * **Current password:** It is the password you have just set for your account.

3. Select the corresponding vault from the **Vault** drop-down list to add the account to it.

**NOTE:** This drop-down list is not displayed if you only have access to one vault.

4. Click the **Connect account** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.
The account is added to your workspace and displayed in the **All Accounts** page.

Now you are done.
