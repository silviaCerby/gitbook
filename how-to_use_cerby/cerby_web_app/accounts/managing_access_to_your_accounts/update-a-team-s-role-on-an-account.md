As an account **Owner** , you can update the role of other teams on your accounts using the Cerby web app. To do so, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Click the **Settings** (<img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/unnamed_13.png" alt="">) icon of the corresponding account card. The account details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.
3. Activate the **Teams** tab. The **Teams** section is displayed with a table of teams who have shared access to the account.
4. Select the option from the **Cerby role** drop-down list that corresponds to the new role on the account:

   * **Owner:** Teams can share accounts, manage access and account configuration, and view passwords through the user interface (UI) and API responses.
   * **Collaborator:** Teams can only view passwords through API responses for account login with Cerby; viewing passwords through the UI is restricted.

A success message box is displayed.

Now you are done.
