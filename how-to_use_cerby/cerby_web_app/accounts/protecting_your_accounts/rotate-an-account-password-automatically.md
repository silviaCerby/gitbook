# Rotate an account password automatically

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace**Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , and **Users**
* Account**Owners**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As the **Owner** of an account for a supported [managed app](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_f0a859b407), you can rotate its password automatically, ensuring your credentials remain secure without manual intervention.

This is a one-click experience in the Cerby web app, where Cerby runs the automated password rotation server-side and provides a password as robust as possible given the underlying recommendations of your app.

To rotate an account password automatically using the Cerby web app, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Click the corresponding account card. The account details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.
3. Hover the mouse over the **Current password** field. Multiple icons and the **Rotate password** button are displayed.
​**IMPORTANT:** If the **Rotate password** button is not displayed, it means Cerby doesn’t support this automation yet.

4. Click the **Rotate password** button. The **Rotate Password** dialog box is displayed.
5. Click the **Rotate Password** button. The dialog box closes, a status message box is displayed, and Cerby runs the automated password rotation.

**TIP:** You can review the progress of this task in the **[Automation Log](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11642287-explore-the-automation-log)** by selecting the **Automation Log** option from the left menu in the Cerby web app dashboard and looking for the corresponding automation job.

Now you are done.
