As an account **Owner** or **Collaborator** , you can log in manually to your account using the Cerby web app.

This experience is intended for scenarios where [automated login](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/13747818-log-in-to-an-account-automatically-using-the-cerby-web-app) cannot be completed, either because the Cerby browser extension is not installed, it involves a [self-managed account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_079d120056), or the app requires manual intervention due to recent user interface (UI) updates.

To log in to an account manually using the Cerby web app, you must complete the following steps:

1. Open your app’s login page.
2. Copy your login credentials from the Cerby web app and paste them into your app’s login page by completing the following steps:
  1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace in a new browser tab.
  2. Click the corresponding account card. The account details page is displayed with the **General** tab activated.
  3. Hover the mouse over the **Username** field. Multiple icons are displayed.
  4. Click the **Copy** () icon. The username is copied to the clipboard.
  5. Paste the username in your app’s login page.
  6. Repeat steps c to e for the **Current password** and **Cerby Auth MFA code** if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is on and managed by Cerby.
3. Complete the login in your app.

Now you are done.
