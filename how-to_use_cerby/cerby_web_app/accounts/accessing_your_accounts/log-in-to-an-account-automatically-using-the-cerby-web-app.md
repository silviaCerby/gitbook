# Log in to an account automatically using the Cerby web app

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , **Admins** , **Users** , **Login-Only** , and **Guest Users**
* Account **Owners** and **Collaborators**
* Supported using the Cerby web app and browser extension


{% endhint %}

As an account **Owner** or **Collaborator** , you can log in to your account automatically using the Cerby web app.

This is a one-click experience where the Cerby browser extension autofills your login credentials and verification codes when multi-factor authentication (MFA) is on and managed by Cerby.

{% hint style="danger" %}


**IMPORTANT:** You must have already installed the Cerby browser extension or add-on in your browser. For instructions, read the article [Install the Cerby browser extension](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/10755388-install-the-cerby-browser-extension).


{% endhint %}

To log in to an account automatically using the Cerby web app, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Hover the mouse over the corresponding account card. Multiple icons and the **Log in** button are displayed.
3. Click the **Log in** button. Cerby opens a new browser tab and runs the automated login.

**NOTE:** Cerby does its best to autofill your login credentials for [self-managed accounts](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_079d120056). Successful login attempts depend on having the correct login URL and on how complex the app’s user interface is. If you would like us to support a specific app or service provider, please send your request via email to the Customer Support team at [support@cerby.com](mailto:support@cerby.com).


{% endhint %}

Now you are done.
