As an account **Owner** , you can set up and associate a Cerby-managed phone number for your account. This contact detail in your account settings is central to how Cerby secures and streamlines access to your apps.

With a Cerby-managed phone number, all SMS messages are routed to your dedicated in-platform Shared Inbox, providing a centralized and private channel for all digital communications related to your account.

When used as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) verification method, Cerby retrieves the verification codes sent via SMS to the Cerby-managed phone number and enters the codes to perform automated logins for you. These codes are shared with all users who have access to your account, enabling automated logins for them as well. For more information, read the article [Turn on MFA with a Cerby-managed phone number for your account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11889236-turn-on-mfa-with-a-cerby-managed-phone-number-for-your-account).

**IMPORTANT:** Depending on what the app supports, Cerby provides VoIP or non-VoIP phone numbers based in the US (using the +1 country code) for your accounts. Additionally, some apps may not support Cerby-managed email addresses.
