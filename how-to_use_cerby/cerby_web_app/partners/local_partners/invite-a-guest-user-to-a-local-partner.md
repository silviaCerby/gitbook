# Invite a Guest User to a local partner

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Host Admins** and **Guest Admins** of a local partner
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a **Host Admin** or **Guest Admin** of a [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2), you can invite one or multiple external collaborators as **Guest Users** of your workspace. After they join Cerby, you can start granting them access to the necessary accounts for collaboration through the local partner.

{% hint style="info" %}


**IMPORTANT:**

* **Guest Users** can only view and receive access to items shared with them by account **Owners** and **Managers**.
* Users already added as guest users in the workspace can’t be added again through a partnership connected to the same workspace.


{% endhint %}

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
