As an account **Owner** from the host workspace, you can accept or decline an access request for an account shared with a guest workspace via a host-guest partnership.

To accept the request and share access to the account, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.

**NOTE:** You can also click the **Open in Cerby** button from the access request email you received, which will redirect you to the account details page with the **Members** tab activated. You can continue in step 3.

2. Click the **Settings** icon of the corresponding account card. The account details page is displayed with the **Settings** tab activated.
3. Activate the **Members** tab. A table with account members is displayed. Members with a pending request are displayed with the **Decline** and **Accept** buttons in the **Status** column.
4. Click the **Accept** button of the corresponding account member. A success message box is displayed, and the account card is displayed in the Cerby dashboard of the corresponding guest workspace member.
