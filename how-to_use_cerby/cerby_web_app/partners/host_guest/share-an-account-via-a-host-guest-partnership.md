# Share an account via a host-guest partnership

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* **Partnership Owners**
* Available to Cerby Automate
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a **Partnership Owner** from the host workspace, you can share access to your accounts with a guest workspace via a host-guest partnership.

By default, the only user in the guest workspace who receives shared access to your accounts is the guest workspace **Admin** , and you can assign them the **Collaborator** or **Manager** role. With the **Manager** role, they can request access to these accounts for other guest workspace members.
