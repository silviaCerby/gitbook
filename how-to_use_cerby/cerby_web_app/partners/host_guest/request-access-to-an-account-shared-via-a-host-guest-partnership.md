As a guest workspace member with the **Manager** role on an account shared via a host-guest partnership, you can request access to account **Owners** from the host workspace.

This request can be accepted or declined; when accepted, the account is shared with the specified guest workspace members.

To request access to an account, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Click the **Request share access for this account** icon from the corresponding account card in the **All accounts** view. The **Request share access** dialog box is displayed.
3. Enter in the search bar the name or email address of the guest workspace member you want to share the account with.
4. Select the corresponding member from the list. The user is added to a list below the search bar.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary.
6. Select the role to assign to the guest workspace members on the shared account:

   * **Collaborator:** With this role, guest workspace members can only log in to the shared account.
   * **Account manager:** With this role, guest workspace members can log in to the shared accounts and request access to these accounts for other members.

7. Click the **Send** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box is displayed.

An email is sent to the account**Owners** from the host workspace to inform them about the access request.
