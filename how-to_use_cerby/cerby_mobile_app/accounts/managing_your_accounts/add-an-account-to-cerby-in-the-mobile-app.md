4. Select the **Account** option from the list. The **Create Account** screen is displayed.
5. Enter your account information in the corresponding fields:

   * **Account label in Cerby:** It is the name to assign to your account in Cerby, and it will be displayed on the account card.

   **NOTE:** In iOS, you must enter the name of your account in the **Enter a name for this account** field.

* **App name or URL:** It is the name of the app or service provider to which the account belongs or the login URL. **​**

**IMPORTANT:** Depending on the account type you want to add, the following happens on this input field:

     * **[Managed accounts](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_f0a859b407)****:** The catalog of managed apps is displayed on a drop-down list when you click the field or as you type. Select the corresponding option.
     * **[Self-managed accounts](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_079d120056):** If the app is not displayed in the list but you access it through its website, you must enter or paste the login URL. For example, <https://www.app.com/login>.
     * **[No URL accounts](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8708338-explore-accounts#h_d754e0f4d9):** You can leave the field blank for the apps you access locally, not through a website (such as hardware devices or desktop apps).
   * **Username:** It is the username you use to log in to your account. Sometimes, the username is your email address.
   * **Current password:** It is the password you use to log in to your account.

6. Select optionally an existing collection from the **Collection** drop-down list to add the account to it.
7. Select the corresponding vault from the **Vault** drop-down list to add the account to it.

**NOTE:** This drop-down list is not displayed if you only have access to one vault.

8. Tap the **Save** **account** button on Android or **Save** button on iOS. The screen closes, and a success message box is displayed.

**NOTE:** You can click the **Add Email linked to account** or **Add Phone number linked to account** buttons to display the corresponding input fields. These are optional fields.

Now you are done.
