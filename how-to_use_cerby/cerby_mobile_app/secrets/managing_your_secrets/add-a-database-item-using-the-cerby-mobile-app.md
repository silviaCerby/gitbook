5. Enter the information in the corresponding fields:

   * **Database label in Cerby:** It is the name of the database item that is always displayed on the secret card.
   * **Type:** It is the type of database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or other database management systems.

6. (Optional) Select the **Ask users to confirm their identity to view the secret** option if you want an identity challenge to be issued when users want to view it.
​**NOTE:** You can add an identity challenge later via the Cerby web app. For more information, read the article [Edit a secret or secret item using the Cerby mobile app](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11429620-edit-a-secret-or-secret-items-to-cerby-using-the-mobile-app).
