# [Deprecated][Video] How to set up your trusted devices

## Key concepts

* A trusted device is any of the three client apps you use to access Cerby: our web app, browser extension, and mobile app.

**IMPORTANT:** You must set up each client app you use, and you will be prompted to do it every time you log in to your workspace.

* The trusted device setup is a security requirement for Cerby Protect users and workspaces with local encryption vaults. Only with a trusted device can you access the items shared with you because these devices hold the keys to decrypt the item data.
* You can only manage your trusted devices through your profile in the Cerby web app.
* For more information about our encryption schemes and trusted devices, read the [How Cerby protects your data with cloud and local encryption](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8376548-how-cerby-protects-your-data-with-cloud-and-local-encryption) and [How to set up and manage your trusted devices](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8142370-how-to-set-up-and-manage-your-trusted-devices) articles.
