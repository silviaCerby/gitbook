# Manage blocked apps and email domains in personal vaults

{% hint style="info" %}


**Who can use this feature?**

* Workspace **Owners** , **Super Admins** , and **Admins**
* Only supported using the Cerby web app


{% endhint %}

As a workspace **Owner** , **Super Admin** , or **Admin** , you can manage the list of blocked apps and domains in the [personal vaults](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/13188897-explore-personal-vaults) of your workspace.

With personal vaults, you can specify which apps and email domains are blocked. Login credentials that match these apps or domains are automatically restricted, ensuring that only personal accounts are saved in personal vaults, while sensitive business login credentials remain protected.

The following are the actions you can perform when managing your personal vaults:
