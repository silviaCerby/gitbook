# Explore Personal Vaults

Cerby’s **Personal Vaults** offers your workspace users a secure, private space for storing and managing their login credentials and sensitive information (accounts) used in the business context, with the option to export this data upon leaving the organization.

By providing a private, encrypted vault, Cerby ensures that only account **Owners** access the stored data. At the same time, workspace **Admins** retain visibility into vault usage and activity without overreaching into personal data.

The following are the main benefits and characteristics of the Personal Vaults feature:

  * Provide users with a secure, private vault for storing their accounts.
  * Control who uses this feature by enabling it for all workspace users, specific teams, or selected users.
  * Apply restrictions so that business login credentials for specific domains and apps are not saved in personal vaults.
  * Ensure audit visibility for admins while maintaining user privacy of vault content.
* * *

## Personal vault settings

When turning on the Personal Vaults feature for your workspace, the following settings are available for configuration:

  * **Vault type:** All your new personal vaults use the cloud encryption scheme.
  * **Vault scope:** Specify which users are allowed to use personal vaults: all workspace users, selected teams, or selected users.
  * **Blocked domains:** Add one or more domains whose login credentials cannot be saved to a personal vault.
  * **Blocked apps:** Select one or more critical apps whose login credentials cannot be saved to a personal vault.
* * *

## End-user personal vaults

When enabled, the Personal Vaults feature provides selected users with a secure, private vault to manage their accounts and sensitive information. Users can perform the following actions within their personal vault:

  * View existing items
  * Add new items
  * Edit or remove items
* * *

## Protecting business credentials

Cerby enforces safeguards to prevent users from storing business login credentials in personal vaults. Workspace **Admins** can configure blocking at two levels to prevent users from saving sensitive business accounts in their personal vaults:

* **Domain blocking** : Login credentials using usernames or emails from specified company or partner domains are automatically blocked from being saved in personal vaults.
* **Apps blocking** : Login credentials for selected managed applications can also be blocked, preventing these business accounts from being stored in personal vaults.

With these controls, admins can ensure personal vaults are used only for personal accounts, while business login credentials remain protected under organizational management.
