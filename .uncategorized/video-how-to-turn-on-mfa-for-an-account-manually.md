# [Video] How to turn on MFA for an account manually

## Key concepts

* Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a second layer of protection for your accounts. When you configure Cerby as an authenticator app for MFA, Cerby generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) for your account and distributes them during login to all users with shared access to the account. For more information, read the article [Explore the Cerby-managed verification methods for your accounts](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5457562-explore-the-cerby-managed-verification-methods-for-your-accounts).
* Only account **Owners** can turn on MFA for an account through Cerby.
* For the setup, you need access to your app, to the Cerby web app, and Cerby mobile app. You can scan a QR code or provide a secret key.
