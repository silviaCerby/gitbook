# [Video] How to join a local partner as a guest user

## Key concepts

* A [local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8980877-explore-partners#h_7e4add33a2) enables **Guest Users** to join a subgroup or organization within a workspace to receive shared access to the accounts they need for collaboration.
* **Guest Admins** of a local partner must follow the process to join a workspace as **Guest Users**.
* After joining a Cerby workspace, all **Guest Users** must set up a trusted session for their devices and turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA). For instructions, read the following articles:

  1. [Set up trusted sessions on your devices](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8142370-set-up-trusted-sessions-on-your-devices)
  2. [Turn on MFA for your Cerby account](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/8011381-create-and-configure-a-local-user-workspace#h_295eef3f10)

* Access to accounts shared by **Host Admins** via a local partner is granted as follows:
  * **Guest Admins** are granted the **Collaborator** or **Manager** role on the accounts. As **Managers** , they can share these accounts with other **Guest Users**. For instructions, see the video [How to share an account via a local partner](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/11511608-video-how-to-share-an-account-via-a-local-partner).
  * **Guest Users** are only granted the **Collaborator** role.
