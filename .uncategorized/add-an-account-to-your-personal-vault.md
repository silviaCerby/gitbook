As a workspace **Owner** , **Super Admin** , **Admin,** or**User** with a [personal vault](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/13188897-explore-personal-vaults) turned on, you can add an account to your personal vault.

Accounts stored in a personal vault are private and visible only to you. They are not shared with other workspace members, and workspace admins cannot view or manage their security settings.

To add an account to your personal vault, you must complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) workspace.
2. Click the **Add item** button located at the top right. A drop-down menu is displayed.
3. Select the **Account** option from the drop-down list. The **Add account** details dialog box is displayed.
4. Enter your account information in the corresponding fields:
  1. **Account label in Cerby** : It is the name to assign to your account in Cerby, and it will be displayed on the account card.
  2. **App name or URL:** It is the name of the app or service provider to which the account belongs or the login URL.
  3. **Username:** It is the username you use to log in to your account. Sometimes, the username is your email address.
  4. **Current password:** It is the password you use to log in to your account.
​**TIP:** You can generate a password by clicking the **Generate password** option.

5. Select your personal vault from the **Vault** drop-down menu. Your personal vault is identified as **< your name> Personal Vault**.
6. Click the **Add account** button. The dialog box closes, and a success message box and the account details page are displayed.

Now you are done.
