# Explore the Cerby web app

The Cerby web app is the central administrative and management platform for your workspace. While the Cerby mobile app and browser extension are focused on providing secure access and authentication for end users, the web app serves as the command center for configuring security policies, managing members, and organizing assets.

With the Cerby web app, you can ensure that all "disconnected" apps—those not natively integrated with your corporate Identity Provider (IdP)—are secured and properly managed.

## Key features

The Cerby web app provides the following key features:

* **Workspace Administration**: Manage users, teams, and roles within your Cerby environment.
* **Asset Management**: Add and configure accounts, secrets, and collections to organize how your organization shares access.
* **MFA Management**: Set up, view, or turn off Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods for your managed accounts.
* **Security Hub**: Monitor the security health of your workspace, address automation task issues, and assign owners to orphaned accounts.
* **Integration Configuration**: Connect your workspace to external services such as Identity Providers (IdPs) or Business Hubs (e.g., Meta Business Manager or TikTok for Business).



## Benefits

Using the Cerby web app offers the following benefits:

* **Centralized Visibility**: Gain a bird’s-eye view of all corporate accounts and secrets in one place.
* **Enhanced Security Control**: Enforce security policies and password rotations across accounts that typically lack corporate oversight.
* **Streamlined Onboarding**: Easily invite new members or guest users and assign them to the specific teams and collections they need.
* **Automation Management**: Track the status of automated tasks, such as password rotations or member syncing, to ensure your access remains uninterrupted.
